# Salvation Belongs to Our God

Salvation belongs to our God
who sits upon the throne
and unto the Lamb. 

-----

Praise and glory,
wisdom and thanks,
honor and power and strength…

-----

be to our God forever and ever…
be to our God forever and ever…
be to our God forever and ever, Amen.

And we the redeemed shall be strong
in purpose and unity,
declaring aloud:

-----

Praise and glory,
wisdom and thanks,
honor and power and strength…

-----

be to our God forever and ever…
be to our God forever and ever…
be to our God forever and ever, Amen. 

-----

Praise and glory,
wisdom and thanks,
honor and power and strength…

-----

be to our God forever and ever…
be to our God forever and ever…
be to our God forever and ever, Amen.
Forever and ever, Amen.
Forever and ever, Amen.
