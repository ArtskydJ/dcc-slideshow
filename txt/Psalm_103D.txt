# Psalm 103D (vv. 19-22)

In the heavens by the LORD's hand He established there His throne. 
Over all is His dominion, He is King and He alone.

-----

Bless the LORD, you mighty angels, You that hear and do His will. 
Bless the LORD, all you His servants Who His pleasure do fulfill.

-----

Bless the LORD, all you His armies, You His works, with one accord 
In all parts of His dominion; O my soul, O bless the LORD.
