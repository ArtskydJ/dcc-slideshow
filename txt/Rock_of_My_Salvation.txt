# Psalm 31:1-2, 23-24 (Rock of My Salvation) 

You are the Rock of my salvation,
you are the strength of my life. 
You are my hope and my inspiration,
Lord, unto You will I cry. 

-----

In You, O LORD, I put my trust;
let me never be ashamed. 
Deliver me in Your righteousness,
bow down Your ear to me,
deliver me with speed. 

-----

You are the Rock of my salvation,
You are the strength of my life. 
You are my hope and my inspiration,
LORD, unto You will I cry.

-----

Oh, love the LORD, all you His saints!
The faithful He preserves. 
The proud fully He does repay.
Be of good courage His Saints! 

-----

And He shall strengthen
your heart to serve Him,
all you who hope in the LORD. 
Great is Your goodness,
O Sovereign LORD,
blessed be the LORD!
