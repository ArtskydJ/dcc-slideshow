# For This Purpose

For this purpose Christ was reveal'd to destroy all the works of the evil one. 
Christ in us has overcome, so with gladness we sing

-----

Over sin He has conguer'd, 
Hallelujah, He has conquer'd.
Over death victorious, 
Hallelujah, victorious, 
Over sickness He has trioumph'd, 
Hallelujah, He has triumph'd.

-----

In the name of Jesus we stand,
by the pow'r of His blood 
we now claim this ground. Satan has no authority pow'rs of darkness must flee, 
for Christ has the victory.

-----

Over sin He has conguer'd, 
Hallelujah, He has conquer'd.
Over death victorious, 
Hallelujah, victorious, 
Over sickness He has trioumph'd, 
Hallelujah, He has triumph'd.
