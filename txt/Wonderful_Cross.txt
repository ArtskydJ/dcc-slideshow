# The Wonderful Cross

When I survey the wondrous cross
on which the Prince of Glory died,
my richest gain I count but loss,
and pour contempt on all my pride.

-----

See, from His head, His hands, His feet, sorrow and love flow mingled down:
did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
or thorns compose so rich a crown?

-----

O the wonderful cross,
O the wonderful cross
bids me come and die
and find that I may truly live. 

-----

O the wonderful cross,
O the wonderful cross,
all who gather here
by grace draw near
and bless your name.

-----

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
that were an off'ring far too small.
Love so amazing, so divine,
demands my soul, my life, my all.

-----

O the wonderful cross,
O the wonderful cross
bids me come and die
and find that I may truly live. 

-----

O the wonderful cross,
O the wonderful cross,
all who gather here
by grace draw near
and bless your name. 

-----

O the wonderful cross,
O the wonderful cross
bids me come and die
and find that I may truly live. 

-----

O the wonderful cross,
O the wonderful cross,
all who gather here
by grace draw near
and bless your name.
