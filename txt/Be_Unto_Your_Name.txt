# Be Unto Your Name

We are a moment, You are forever,
Lord of the ages, God before time; 
We are a vapor, You are eternal,
Love everlasting, reigning on high.

-----

Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
worthy is the Lamb Who was slain; 
Highest praises honor and glory
be unto Your name, be unto Your name

-----

We are the broken, You are the healer,
Jesus Redeemer, Mighty to save;
You are the love song we'll sing forever,
bowing before You, blessing Your name.

-----

Holy holy Lord God Almighty,
worthy is the Lamb Who was slain; 
Highest praises honor and glory
be unto Your name, be unto Your name
Be unto Your name.
