# Psalm 21B

Because the king trusts in the LORD His confidence is sure; And through the love of Him Most High, The king is kept secure. Your hand will search for enemies and find out all Your foes, and all who harbor hate for You Your right hand will oppose.

-----

In anger You will burn them up at Your appointed hour; the LORD will swallow them in wrath, in fiery flames devour. Their fruit You will remove from earth, their children from mankind. Their evil plots will not succeed, nor schemes they have designed.

-----

For You will make them all retreat Your arrows are in place and on Your bowstring they are aimed to strike them in the face. In Your mighty strength, O LORD, Exalt Yourself on high; then we will sing with psalms of praise, Your power glorify.
