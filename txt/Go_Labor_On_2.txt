# Go, Labor On

Go, labor on: spend and be spent,
your joy to do the Father's will;
it is the way the Master went;
should not the servant tread it still?

-----

Go, labor on: 'tis not for naught;
your earthly loss is heav'nly gain;
men heed you, love you, praise you not; the Master praises- what are men?

-----

Go, labor on: enough while here
if he should praise you, if he deign
your willing heart to mark and cheer;
no toil for him shall be in vain.

-----

Go, labor on while it is day:
the world's dark night is hast'ning on.
Speed, speed your work, cast sloth away; it is not thus that souls are won.

-----

Toil on, faint not, keep watch and pray;
be wise the erring soul to win;
go forth into the world's highway,
compel the wand'rer to come in.

-----

Toil on, and in your toil rejoice;
for toil comes rest, for exile home;
soon shall you hear the Bridegroom's voice,
the midnight peal, "Behold, I come."
