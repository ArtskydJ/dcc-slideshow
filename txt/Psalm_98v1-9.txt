# Psalm 98:1-9 

Sing a new song to Jehovah
for the wonders he has wrought;
his right hand and arm most holy
have to His salvation brought.

-----

Lo, Jehovah his salvation
has to all the world made known;
in the sight of every nation
he, his righteousness has shown.

-----

Mindful of his truth and mercy
he to Is'rel's house has been;
of our God the great salvation
all the ends of earth have seen.

-----

Sing, O earth, sing to Jehovah;
shout aloud, rejoice, and sing.
with the harp sing to Jehovah,
with melodious voice and string.

-----

Sound the trumpet and the cornet;
shout before the Lord, the King;
seas and all their fullness, thunder;
earth with all its people, sing.

-----

Let the rivers in their gladness
clap their hands with one accord;
let the mountains sing together
and rejoice before the Lord.
