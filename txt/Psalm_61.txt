# Psalm 61

Hear my cry, O God;
Attend to my prayer. 
From the end of the earth
I will cry to you,
When my heart is overwhelmed;
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

-----

For You have been
a shelter for me.
A strong tow'r
from the enemy.
I will abide
in Your tabernacle forever;
I will trust
in the shelter of Your wings.

-----

For You, O God,
have heard my vows;
You have given me the heritage
of those who fear Your name.
You will prolong the king's life,
His years as many generations.
He forever shall abide before God.

-----

Oh prepare
mercy and truth,
Which may preserve him!
So I will sing praise to your name forever, That I may daily perform my vows.
