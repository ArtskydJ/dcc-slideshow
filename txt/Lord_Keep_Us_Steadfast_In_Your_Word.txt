# Lord, Keep Us Steadfast in Your Word 

Lord, keep us steadfast in your Word;
curb those who by deceit or sword
would wrest the kingdom from your Son
and bring to naught all he has done.

-----

Lord Jesus Christ, your power make known,
for you are Lord of lords alone;
defend your holy Church, that we
may sing your praise triumphantly.

-----

O Comforter of priceless worth,
send peace and unity on earth;
support us in our final strife
and lead us out of death to life.
