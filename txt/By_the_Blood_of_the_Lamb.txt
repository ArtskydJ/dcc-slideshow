# By the Blood of the Lamb

We wrestle not against flesh and blood
but we war against the powers of darkness;
for we are mighty through God
by the blood of His Son
that has rendered the enemy powerless.

-----

We are pulling down ev'ry work of Satan,
pushing back ev'ry force of hell;
casting down the imaginations
that exalt themselves.

-----

We are tearing down ev'ry deed of darkness,
breaking up ev'ry evil plan;
casting out ev'ry demon spirit
by the blood of the Lamb,
by the blood of the Lamb.

By the blood of the Lamb,
by the blood of the Lamb.
