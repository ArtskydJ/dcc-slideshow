# The Son of God Goes Forth to War

The Son of God goes forth to war,
a kingly crown to gain;
His blood-red banner streams afar;
who follows in His train?

-----

Who best can drink His cup of woe, triumphant over pain,
Who patient bears His cross below,
he follows in His train.

-----

The martyr first, whose eagle eye
could pierce beyond the grave,
Who saw his Master in the sky,
and called on Him to save.

-----

Like Him, with pardon on His tongue
in midst of mortal pain,
He prayed for them that did the wrong:
who follows in His train?

-----

A glorious band, the chosen few
on whom the Spirit came,
Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew, and mocked the cross and flame.

-----

They met the tyrant's brandished steel,
the lion's gory mane;
They bowed their necks the death to feel: who follows in their train?

-----

A noble army, men and boys,
the matron and the maid,
Around the Savior's throne rejoice,
in robes of light arrayed.

-----

They climbed the steep ascent of heav'n
thro' peril, toil, and pain:
O God, to us may grace be giv'n
to follow in their train.
