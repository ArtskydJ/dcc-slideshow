# Within His Heart the Fool Spoke

Within his heart the fool spoke,
and said, "There is no God!" 
Destructive in their vile deeds,
not one of them does good. 
The lord looks down from heaven
upon the human race: 
has anyone shown wisdom,
does any seek God's face?

-----

Together they're corrupted;
they all have turned aside. 
Not one for good has labored,
not even one has tried. 
Have all of them no knowledge
whose deeds are so abhorred? 
Like bread they eat my people,
and call not on the Lord.

-----

There they will be in terror,
for God is with the just. 
Though you would shame the wretched,
the Lord remains his trust. 
From Zion, send salvation,
and help to Isr'el bring! 
The Lord restores His captives:
Let Jacob Isr'el sing!
