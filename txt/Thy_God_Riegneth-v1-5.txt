# Thy God Reigneth!

Trembling soul, beset by fears, "Thy God reigneth!" Look above and dry they tears: "Thy God reigneth!" Though they foes with pow'r assail, naught against thee shall prevail; trust in him he'll never fail: "Thy God reigneth! thy God reigneth!'

Sinful sould, they debt is paid, "Thy God reigneth!" On the Lord thy sins were laid, "Thy God reigneth!" On the cross of Calvary, Jesus shed his blood for thee, from all sin to set thee free: "Thy God reigneth! They God reigneth!"

-----

Seeking soul, to Jesus turn; "Thy God reigneth!" None that seek him will he spurn; "Thy God reigneth!" Wand'ring sheep the Shepherd seeks, and when found he ever keeps, from all sin to set thee free: "Thy God reigneth! They God reigneth!"

-----

Join, ye saints, the truth proclaim, "Thy God reigneth!" Shout it forth with glad acclaim, "Thy God reigneth!" Zion, wake! The morn is nigh, see it break from yonder sky; lud and clear the watchmen cry: "Thy God reigneth!, they God reigneth!"

-----

Church of Christ, awake, awake! "Thy God reigneth!" Forward, then, fresh courage take: "Thy God reigneth!" Soon, descending from his throne, he shall claim thee for his own; sin shall then be overthrown:"Thy God reigneth!, thy God reigneth!"
