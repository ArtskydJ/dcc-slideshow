# Love Constraining To Obedience

No strength of nature can suffice
To serve the Lord aright
And what she has, she misapplies,
For want of clearer light.
To see the Law by Christ fulfilled,
To hear His pardoning voice,
Changes a slave into a child
And duty to a choice.

-----

How long beneath the Law I lay
In bondage and distress
I toiled the precept to obey,
But toiled without success.
To see the Law by Christ fulfilled,
To hear His pardoning voice,
Changes a slave into a child
And duty to a choice.

-----

Then to abstain from outward sin
Was more than I could do
Now if I feel its power within
I feel I hate it too.
To see the Law by Christ fulfilled,
To hear His pardoning voice,
Changes a slave into a child
And duty to a choice.

-----

Then all my servile works were done,
A righteousness to raise
Now, freely chosen in the Son,
I freely choose His ways.
To see the Law by Christ fulfilled,
To hear His pardoning voice,
Changes a slave into a child
And duty to a choice.
