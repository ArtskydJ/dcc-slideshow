# O LORD Our Lord (Psalm 8)

O LORD, our Lord,
how excellent is your name in all the earth. 
O LORD, our Lord,
how excellent is your name in all the earth.

-----

You have set your glory above the heavens,
from children's lips you have ordained praise; 
you have set the moon and the stars in place,
and you still remember me. 

-----

O LORD, our Lord,
how excellent is your name in all the earth. 
O LORD, our Lord,
how excellent is your name in all the earth.

-----

What is man, that you are mindful of him;
the son of man that you take care of him?
You have put everything beneath his feet,
and made him ruler of your works.

-----

O LORD, our Lord,
how excellent is your name in all the earth. 
O LORD, our Lord,
how excellent is your name in all the earth.

-----

O LORD, our Lord,
how excellent is your name in all the earth. 
O LORD, our Lord,
how excellent is your name in all the earth.
