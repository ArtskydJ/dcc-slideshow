# All Hail the Power / Psalm 96

O sing a new song to the LORD;
all earth sing to the LORD. 
Sing to the LORD, and bless his name;
"He saves!" each day proclaim. 
His glory to all nations show;
his deeds let peoples know.

-----

The LORD is great, how great his praise! 
above all gods he's feared. 
For heathen gods are idols vain;
the LORD the heavens made. 
Before him honor, majesty,
and strength and splendor be! 

-----

O families of earth, ascribe
all glory to the LORD! 
All strength ascribe unto the LORD;
the glory of his name; 
Give to the LORD, to his courts come 
and bring an offering.
