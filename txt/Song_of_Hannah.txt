# Song of Hannah (1 Sam. 2:1-10)

My soul is filled with
joy in God my Savior,
for he has lifted
me and set me high.

-----

There is no Holy
One no Rock like our God;
he answered my request,
he heard my cry.

-----

All those who talk with
pride now see who God is:
he weighs our deeds and
knows our every word.

-----

Proud ones are humbled,
but the poor are lifted;
all might and power
belong to God the LORD.

-----

The strong have fallen,
but the weak are strengthened;
those who were hungry
have enough to spare.

-----

She who was barren
sees her children's children;
all things are in the LORD'S
controlling care.

-----

The LORD has set the
earth on sure foundations;
help for his saints is
found in God alone.

-----

Those who oppose the
LORD will fall in judgment,
but he will strengthen
his anointed one.
