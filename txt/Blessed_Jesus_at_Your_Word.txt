# Blessed Jesus, at Your Word 

BlessÃ¨d Jesus, at thy word
we are gathered all to hear you;
let our hearts and souls be stirred
now to seek and love and fear you,
by your teachings sweet and holy,
drawn from earth to love thee solely.

-----

All our knowledge, sense and sight
lie in deepest darkness shrouded,
til your Spirit breaks our night
with the beams of truth unclouded.
You alone to God can win us;
you must work all good within us.

-----

Glorious Lord, yourself impart!
Light of light, from God proceeding,
open now our ears and heart;
help us by your Spirit's pleading;
hear the cry your people raises;
hear and bless our prayers and praises.

-----

Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
praise to you and adoration!
Grant that we your word may trust
and obtain true consolation
while we here below must wander,
till we sing your praises yonder.
