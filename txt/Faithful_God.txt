# Faithful God 

Faithful God, covenant keeper,
always true to honour your word. 
In a world built on sand,
you are the Rock on which I stand. 
Faithful God, faithful to care for me,
you are my hope, to you I cleave. 

-----

Faithful God, faithful you'll ever be.
Your loving kindness and grace,
fill me with wonder and praise,
I'll always trust you, faithful God.
