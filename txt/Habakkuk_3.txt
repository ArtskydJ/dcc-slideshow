# Habakkuk 3:17-19

Though the fig tree should not blossom,
and there be no fruit on the vine,
though the yield of the olive shall fail,
and the fields produce no food;
though the flock may be cut off from the fold,
and there be no cattle in the stalls

-----

Yet I will rejoice in the LORD,
yet I will rejoice in the LORD,
yet I will rejoice in
the God of my salvation.

The LORD is my strength,
he will make my feet like deer's feet,
and on my high hills he will make me walk.
I will rejoice in the LORD,
I will rejoice in the LORD,
I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.
