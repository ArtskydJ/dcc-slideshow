# Psalm 42

To you, O Lord, I lift my voice;
I supplication make.
I pour my thoughts out to the Lord,
to Him my trouble take.

-----

For when my soul is overwhelmed,
my every way you see.
Upon the path on which I walk
their traps were laid for me.

-----

None notices. Look to my right,
no one regards me there.
There's no escape for me to take,
and none to show me care.

-----

I cried to you, O Lord, and said,
"You are my refuge true;
and in the land of those who live,
my portion is with you."

-----

Since I'm brought low in misery,
O listen to my cry;
save me from persecuting foes
who stronger are then I.

-----

So, out of bondage, bring my soul
that I your name may praise;
the righteous then will join with me,
for you have shown me grace.
