# Under The Care

Under the care of my God the Almighty,
safe in the secret place of the Most High!
He is my refuge, the Lord is my fortress,
him I am trusting when trouble is nigh. 

-----

Be not afraid for the terror of midnight,
nor for the arrow that hasteth to slay;
fear not the pestilence walking in darkness,
nor the destroyer that wasteth by day.

-----

Under his wings, under his wings,
safe in the refuge hide thee;
trusting his truth and faithfulness,
no evil can betide thee.

-----

Seek the Most High for thy sure habitation,
unto Jehovah for refuge now fly;
there shall be no evil befall thee or harm thee,
unto thy dwelling no plague shall come nigh.

-----

Love thou the Lord, surely he will deliver;
he will exalt thee and answer thy prayer;
he will be with thee, to honor and give thee
life without end, his salvation to share.

-----

Under his wings, under his wings,
safe in the refuge hide thee;
trusting his truth and faithfulness,
no evil can betide thee.
