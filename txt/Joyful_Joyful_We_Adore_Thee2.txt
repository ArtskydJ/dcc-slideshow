# Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee

Joyful, joyful, we adore thee, 
God of glory, Lord of love;
hearts unfold like flowers before thee, 
hail thee as the sun above.

-----

Melt the clouds of sin and sadness; 
drive the dark of doubt away. 
Giver of immortal gladness, 
fill us with the light of day!

-----

All thy works with joy surround thee, 
earth and heaven reflect thy rays,
stars and angels sing around thee, 
center of unbroken praise. 

-----

Field and forest, vale and mountain, 
flowery meadow, flashing sea,
singing bird and flowing fountain, 
call us to rejoice in thee.

-----

Thou art giving and forgiving, 
ever blessing, ever blest,
well-spring of the joy of living,
ocean depth of happy rest! 

-----

Thou our Father, Christ our brother,
all who live in love are thine;
teach us how to love each other,
lift us to the joy divine.

-----

Mortals, join the mighty chorus,
which the morning stars began;
love divine is reigning o'er us,
binding all within its span. 

-----

Ever singing, march we onward, 
victors in the midst of strife; 
joyful music leads us sunward,
in the triumph song of life.
