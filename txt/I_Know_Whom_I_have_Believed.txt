# I Know Whom I have Believed 

I know not why God's wondrous grace
to me he hath made known, 
nor why, unworthy, Christ
in love redeemed me for his own. 

-----

But I know whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that he is able 
to keep that which I've committed
unto him against that day. 

-----

I know not how this saving faith
to me he did impart, 
nor how believing in his word
wrought peace within my heart. 

-----

But I know whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that he is able 
to keep that which I've committed
unto him against that day. 

-----

I know not how the Spirit moves,
convincing us of sin, 
revealing Jesus through the word,
creating faith in him. 

-----

But I know whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that he is able 
to keep that which I've committed
unto him against that day. 

-----

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see.

-----

But I know whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that he is able 
to keep that which I've committed
unto him against that day. 

-----

I know not when my Lord may come,
at night or noonday fair, 
nor if I walk the vale with him,
or meet him in the air. 

-----

But I know whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that he is able 
to keep that which I've committed
unto him against that day.
