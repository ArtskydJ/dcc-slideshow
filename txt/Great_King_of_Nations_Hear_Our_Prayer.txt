# Great King of Nations, Hear Our Prayer

Great King of nations
hear our prayer, 
while at your feet we fall,
and humbly with
united cry
to You for mercy call. 

-----

The guilt is ours, but grace is yours,
O turn us not away;
But hear us from your lofty throne,
and help us when we pray.

-----

Our father's sins were manifold,
and ours no less we own,
Yet wondrously from age to age
your goodness has been shown.

-----

When dangers, like a stormy sea,
beset our country round,
Yet wondrously from age to age
your goodness has been shown.

-----

With one consent we meekly bow
beneath your chast'ning hand,
and, pouring forth confession meet,
mourn with our mourning land.

-----

With pitying eye behold our need,
as thus we lift our prayer;
correct us with your judgments, Lord
then let your mercy spare.
