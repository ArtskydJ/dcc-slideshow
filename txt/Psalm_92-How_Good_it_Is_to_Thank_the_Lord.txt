# Psalm 92/How Good It Is to Thank the Lord

How good it is to thank the Lord, and praise to you, Most High, accord, to show your love with morning light,
and tell you faithfulness each night; yea, good it is your praise to sing, and all our sweetest music bring.

-----

O Lord, with joy my heart expands before the wonders of your hands; great works, Jehovah, you have wrought,
exceeding deep your ev'ry thought; a foolish man knows not their worth, nor he whose mind is of the earth.

-----

When as the grass the wicked grow, when sinners flourish here below, then is there endless ruin nigh,
but you, O Lord, are throned on high; your foes shall fall before your might, the wicked shall be put to flight.

-----

The righteous man shall flourish well, and in the house of God shall dwell; he shall be like a goodly tree,
and all his life shall fruitful be; for righteous is the Lord and just, he is my rock, in him I trust.
