# Why Do Gentile Nations Rage? (Psalm 2)

Why do Gentile nations rage,
And their useless plots design?
Kings of earth in schemes engage,
Rulers are in league combined.
They speak out against the LORD;
His Messiah they defy:
"Let us break their chains and cords,
Let us cast them off," they cry.

-----

He who sits in heaven laughs,
For the Lord views them with scorn.
He will speak to them in wrath,
And in anger He will warn:
"Yet according to My will,
I have set My King to reign;
And on Zion's holy hill,
My Anointed will remain."

-----

"I the LORD's decree make known;
This is what He had to say:
He declared, 'You are My Son;
I have brought You forth this day.
Ask of Me and You I'll make
Heir to earth and nations all.
Them with iron rod You'll break,
Smashing them in pieces small.'"

-----

Therefore kings now heed this word:
Earthly judges, come and hear.
Rev'rent worship give the LORD;
With your joy mix trembling fear.
Honor Him, His wrath to turn,
Lest you perish in your stride,
For His anger soon may burn.
Blessed are all who in Him hide.
