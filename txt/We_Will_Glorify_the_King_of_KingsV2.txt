# We Will Glorify

We will glorify the King of Kings,
we will glorify the Lamb; 
We will glorify the Lord of lords, who is the great I AM.

Lord Jehovah reigns In majesty, we will bow before His throne; 
We will worship Him in righteousness, we well worship Him alone.

You are Lord of heaven, Lord of earth, You are Lord of all who live; 
You are Lord above the universe, all praise to You we give.
