# Blessed Be the Name of the LORD

Blessed be the name of the LORD.
He is worthy to be praised and adored.
So we lift up holy hands in one accord, Singing, 
"Blessed be the name
blessed be the name,
blessed be the name of the LORD."

-----

Blessing, honor, glory and all pow'r,
wisdom, riches, and all strength evermore, give ye to the LORD who has the battle won.

-----

His the kingdom, his the throne,
destined to renown,
Blessed be the name of the LORD.
Blessed be the name of the LORD.
Blessed be the name of the LORD.
