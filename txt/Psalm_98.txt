# Psalm 98

Oh, sing to the Lord a new song,
marvelous things He has done before us.
His right hand and His holy arm
have gained Him the victory. 

-----

For the Lord has made His salvation known, and His righteousness to the nations shown and remembered mercy and truth to Israel's house. 

-----

Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna to the King. 
Let the rivers clap, As they roll along,
Let the mountains burst into joyful song.
Let the people shout as they celebrate and praise.

> Men: . Women: 

-----

Shout for joy to the Lord all the earth,
Burst into jubilant song together; 
Make music to the Lord all the earth,
Let creation respond with singing.

> ALL: 

-----

Let the sea resound, let the world rejoice,
Let the trumpet blast with a mighty voice,
Let the people dance as they
celebrate and praise. 

> ALL: 

-----

Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna to the King. 
Let the rivers clap, As they roll along,
Let the mountains burst into joyful song.
Let the people shout as they celebrate and praise.

> Men: . Women: 

-----

For the Lord is coming to judge the earth. And with righteousness
He shall judge the world,
And the peoples He shall judge with equity.
