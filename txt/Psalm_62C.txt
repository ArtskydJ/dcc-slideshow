# Psalm 62

On him, O people, evermore
rely with confidence;
before him pour ye out your heart,
for God is our defense.

-----

The sons of man are vanity,
the best of men a lie; 
together in the balance they
are lighter than a sigh.

-----

Then in oppression do not hope,
nor yet for plunder lust; 
though power and force may seem to thrive,
in this build not your trust. 

-----

For truly God has spoken once;
he twice to me made known: 
that strength and power belong to God
and unto him alone.
