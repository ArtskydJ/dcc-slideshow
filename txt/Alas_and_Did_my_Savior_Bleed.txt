# Alas and Did My Savior Bleed

Alas! and did my Saviour bleed,
and did my Sov'reign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
for such a worm as I?
Was it for sins that I had done
He groaned upon the tree?

-----

Amazing pity, grace unknown
and love beyond degree.
My God, why would You shed Your blood
so pure and undefiled 
To make a sinful one like me
Your chosen precious child?

-----

Well might the sun in darkness hide
and shut His glories in 
When Christ, the mighty Maker died
for man the creature's sin.
Thus might I hide my blushing face
while His dear cross appears.

-----

Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
and melt my eyes to tears. 
My God, why would You shed Your blood
so pure and undefiled 
To make a sinful one like me
Your chosen precious child?
