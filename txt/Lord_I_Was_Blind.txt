# Lord, I Was Blind! 

Lord, I was blind:
I could not see 
In Thy marred visage any grace;
But now the beauty of Thy face 
In radiant vision dawns on me.

-----

Lord, I was deaf:
I could not hear 
The thrilling music of Thy voice;
But now I hear Thee and rejoice, 
And all Thine uttered words are dear.

-----

Lord, I was dumb:
I could not speak 
The grace and glory of Thy Name;
But now, as touched with living flame, 
My lips Thine eager praises wake.

-----

Lord, I was dead:
I could not stir 
My lifeless soul to come to Thee;
But now, since Thou hast quickened me, 
I rise from sin's dark sepulcher.

-----

Lord, Thou hast made the blind to see,
The deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, 
The dead to live; and lo, I break
The chains of my captivity.
