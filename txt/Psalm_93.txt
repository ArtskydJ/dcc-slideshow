You reign, O LORD, in majesty;
in majesty, O LORD, you're clothed; 
in strength, O LORD, you gird yourself.
The world is firm, it cannot be moved. 

-----

Your throne, LORD, is sure and firm,
from of old it is established and ordained.
Without end, above all time,
you are everlasting, LORD;
you are the King of kings. 

-----

The floods lift up, their voice, O LORD;
the floods lift up their waves, O LORD. 
The LORD on high, is mightier,
than noise of waters or ocean waves. 

-----

Your testimonies faithful are,
your testimonies are very sure;
and holiness adorns your house,
O LORD, forever and evermore. 
O LORD, forever and evermore.
Yes, LORD, forever and evermore.
