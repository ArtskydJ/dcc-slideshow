# O the Deep, Deep Love of Jesus 

O the deep, deep love of Jesus!
Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free;
rolling as a mighty ocean
in its fullness over me. 

-----

Underneath me, all around me,
is the current of Thy love;
leading onward, leading homeward,
to Thy glorious rest above. 

-----

O the deep, deep love of Jesus! 
Spread His praise from shore to shore;
how He loveth, ever loveth,
changeth never, nevermore; 

-----

how He watches o'er His loved ones,
died to call them all His own;
how for them He intercedeth,
watcheth o'er them from the throne. 

-----

O the deep, deep love of Jesus!
Love of ev'ry love the best:
'tis an ocean vast of blessing,
'tis a haven sweet of rest. 

-----

O the deep, deep love of Jesus! 
'Tis a heav'n of heav'ns to me;
and it lifts me up to glory,
for it lifts me up to Thee.
