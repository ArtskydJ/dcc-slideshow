# O Praise the Lord! (Psalm 112)

O praise the Lord!
The man is truly blessed
who fears the Lord,
and in His law delights.
His children will
be mighty in the earth.
How blessed the children
of all the righteous!

-----

Abundant riches
are within His house,
His righteousness endures
forevermore.
In darkness light
arises for the just;
He's full of mercy;
He's just and gracious.

-----

The gracious man
who freely lends is blessed,
the one who justly
governs his affairs.
The righteous man
will surely not be moved,
he'll be remembered
throughout the ages.

-----

At evil news
he will not be afraid;
his heart is steadfast,
trusting in the Lord.
His heart is firm,
he will not live in fear,
till on his foes he
shall look in triumph.

-----

He helps the poor
with generosity;
his good endures,
his horn is lifted high.
The wicked sees
and grinds his teeth in rage;
but he will vanish
his lust will perish.
