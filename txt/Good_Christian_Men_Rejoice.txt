# Good Christian Men, Rejoice

Good Christian men, rejoice
with heart and soul, and voice;
Give ye heed to what we say:
Jesus Christ is born today;
Earth and heav'n before Him bow,
and He is in the manger now.
Christ is born today!
Christ is born today!

-----

Good Christian men, rejoice,
with heart and soul and voice;
Now ye hear of endless bliss:
Jesus Christ was born for this!
He has opened heaven's door,
and man is blest forevermore.
Christ was born for this!
Christ was born for this!

-----

Good Christian men, rejoice,
with heart and soul and voice;
Now ye need not fear the grave: 
Jesus Christ was born to save!
Calls you one and calls you all,
to gain His everlasting hall.
Christ was born to save!
Christ was born to save!
