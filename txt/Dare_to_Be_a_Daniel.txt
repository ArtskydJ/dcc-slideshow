# Dare to Be a Daniel 

Standing by a purpose true,
heeding God's command, 
honor them, the faithful few!
All hail to Daniel's band!

-----

Dare to be a Daniel,
Dare to stand alone! 
Dare to have a purpose firm!
Dare to make it known.

-----

Many mighty men are lost
Daring not to stand, 
who for God had been a host
by joining Daniel's band.

-----

Dare to be a Daniel,
Dare to stand alone! 
Dare to have a purpose firm!
Dare to make it known.

-----

Many giants, great and tall,
stalking through the land, 
headlong to the earth would fall,
if met by Daniel's band.

-----

Dare to be a Daniel,
Dare to stand alone! 
Dare to have a purpose firm!
Dare to make it known.

-----

Hold the Gospel banner high!
On to vict'ry grand! 
Satan and his hosts defy,
And shout for Daniel's band.

-----

Dare to be a Daniel,
Dare to stand alone! 
Dare to have a purpose firm!
Dare to make it known.
