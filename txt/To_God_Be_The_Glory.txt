# To God Be The Glory

To God be the glory, great things he has done;
So loved he the world that he gave us his Son,
who yielded his life an atonement for sin,
and opened the life gate that all may go in.

-----

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
let the earth hear his voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
and give him the glory, 
great things he has done.

-----

O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
to every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,
that moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

Great things he has taught us, great things he has done,
and great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see
