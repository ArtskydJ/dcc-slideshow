# Psalm 98:1-7

O sing a new song to the LORD
For wonders He has done,
For wonders He has done; 
His right hand and His holy arm
The victory have won,
The victory have won,
The victory have won.

-----

The great salvation wrought by Him
Jehovah has made known,
Jehovah has made known. 
His justice in the nations' sight
He openly has shown.
He openly has shown,
He openly has shown.

-----

He mindful of His grace and truth
To Isr'el's house has been,
To Isr'el's house has been. 
The great salvation of our God
All ends of earth have seen.
All ends of earth have seen,
All ends of earth have seen.

-----

O all the earth, sing to the LORD
And make a joyful sound,
And make a joyful sound. 
Lift up your voice aloud to Him;
Sing psalms! Let joy resound!
Sing psalms! Let joy resound!
Sing psalms! Let joy resound!

-----

With harp make music to the Lord;
With harp a psalm O sing!
With harp a psalm O sing!
With horn and trumpet raise a shout
Before the Lord, the King!
Before the Lord, the King!
Before the Lord, the King!

-----

Let seas in all their vastness roar,
the world, its living horde;
the world, its living horde.
Let rivers clap, let mountains sing
Their joy before the Lord!
Their joy before the Lord!
Their joy before the Lord!

-----

Because He comes, He surely comes,
the judge of earth to be!
The judge of earth to be!
With justice He will judge the world,
All men with equity
All men with equity
All men with equity
