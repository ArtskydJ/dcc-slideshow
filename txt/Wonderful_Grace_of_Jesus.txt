# Wonderful Grace of Jesus

Wonderful grace of Jesus,
greater than all my sin;
How shall my tongue describe it,
where shall its praise begin?

-----

Taking away my burden,
setting my spirit free;
For the wonderful grace of Jesus
reaches me.

-----

Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus,
deeper than the mighty rolling sea; (the rolling sea;)
Won---------------------derful grace, all suf- 
Higher than the mountain sparkling like a fountain
fi------------------cient for me, (for even me;)
all sufficient grace for even me;

-----

Broader than the scope of my transgressions,
Greater far than all my sin and shame, 
O magnify the precious name of Jesus,
Praise his Name!

-----

Wonderful grace of Jesus,
reaching a mighty host,
By it I have been pardoned,
saved to the utter most.

-----

Chains have been torn asunder,
Giving me liberty;
For the wonderful grace of Jesus
reaches me.

-----

Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus,
deeper than the mighty rolling sea; (the rolling sea;)
Won---------------------derful grace, all suf- 
Higher than the mountain sparkling like a fountain
fi------------------cient for me, (for even me;)
all sufficient grace for even me;

Broader than the scope of my transgressions,
Greater far than all my sin and shame, 
O magnify the precious name of Jesus,
Praise his Name!

-----

Wonderful grace of Jesus,
reaching the most defiled,
By its transforming power,
making him God's dear child,

-----

Purchasing peace and heaven,
for all eternity;
And the wonderful grace of Jesus
reaches me.
