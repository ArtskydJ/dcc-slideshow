# We Declare Your Majesty 

We declare your majesty,
we proclaim that your name is exalted; 
for you reign magnificently,
rule victoriously, 
and your power is shown throughout the earth.

-----

And we exclaim
our God is mighty, 
lift up your name,
for you are holy. 
Sing it again,
all honour and glory, 
in adoration
we bow before your throne.

-----

Not to us, Lord, not to us,
but to your Name, O Lord, give the glory. 
From the dawn to setting sun
may grace and truth go forth
to conquer those who now resist your will.

-----

Your kingdom come,
your will be done, Lord, 
upon the earth,
just as in heaven. 
Give to the Lord
all kingdoms and nations, 
the glory due
to the majesty of God.
