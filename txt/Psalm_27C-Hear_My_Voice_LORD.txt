# Psalm 27C

O hear my voice, LORD, when I cry, and
answer me in grace. 
When You said, "Seek my face," my heart said, "LORD, I'll seek Your face."

-----

O do not cause Your face to be concealed
from me, I pray. 
Treat me, Your servant, without wrath;
do not turn me away.

-----

For You have surely been my help, do
not abandon me; 
do not forsake me now, I pray,
O God who rescues me.

My father and my mother both May
leave me all alone, 
but surely then the LORD Himself will
take me as His own.
