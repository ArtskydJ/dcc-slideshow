# Psalm 19B

Perfect is Yahweh's teaching
it gives life to the soul;
sure is his testimony,
which makes the simple wise.
The precepts of God are right,
enlightening the eyes;
clean is the fear of Yahweh,
forever it endures.

-----

True are God's testimonies,
and altogether just.
They're better than fine gold
and sweeter than honey pure.
They warn and give me knowledge;
obedience gives rewards.
But who can see one's own faults?
Clear me from hidden sins.

-----

Keep me from willful sins, Lord;
let them not rule over me.
Then I shall be found blameless,
and free from evil ways.
Let what I say and think be
acceptable to you, 
O Lord; who are my refuge
and my redeeming one.
