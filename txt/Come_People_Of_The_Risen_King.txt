# Come, People Of The Risen King

Come, people of the risen King,
who delight to bring Him praise.
Come, all and tune your hearts to sing
to the morning star of grace.
From the shifting shadows of the earth
we will lift our eyes to Him,
Where steady arms of mercy reach
to gather children in.

-----

Rejoice! Rejoice!
Let every tongue rejoice! 
One heart, one voice, 
O Church of Christ rejoice!

-----

Come, those whose joy is morning sun,
and those weeping through the night.
Come, those who tell of battles won,
and those struggling in the fight. 
For His perfect love will never change
and His mercies never cease, 
but follow us through all our days
with the certain hope of peace.

-----

Rejoice! Rejoice!
Let every tongue rejoice! 
One heart, one voice, 
O Church of Christ rejoice!

-----

Come, young and old from every land
 men and women of the faith. 
Come, those with full or empty hands
find the riches of His grace. 
Over all the world His people sing,
shore to shore we hear them call
the Truth that cries through ev'ry age,
"Our God is all in all!"

-----

Rejoice! Rejoice!
Let every tongue rejoice! 
One heart, one voice, 
O Church of Christ rejoice!

-----

Rejoice! Rejoice!
Let every tongue rejoice! 
One heart, one voice, 
O Church of Christ rejoice!
