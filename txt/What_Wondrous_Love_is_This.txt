# What Wondrous Love is This 

What wondrous love is this,
O my soul, O my soul,
what wondrous love is this, O my soul! 

-----

What wondrous love is this
that caused the Lord of bliss
to bear the dreadful curse
for my soul, for my soul,
to bear the dreadful curse for my soul! 

-----

To God and to the Lamb,
I will sing, I will sing, 
to God and to the Lamb,
I will sing; 

-----

to God and to the Lamb,
who is the great I AM, 
while millions join the theme,
I will sing, I will sing, 
while millions join the theme,
I will sing!

-----

And when from death I'm free,
I'll sing on, I'll sing on; 
and when from death I'm free,
I'll sing on; 

-----

and when from death I'm free,
I'll sing and joyful be, 
and through eternity
I'll sing on, I'll sing on, 
and through eternity I'll sing on!
