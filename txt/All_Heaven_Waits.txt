# All Heaven Waits

All heaven waits with bated breath,
for saints on earth to pray.
Majestic angels ready stand
with swords of fiery blade.
Astounding power awaits a word
from God's resplendent throne.
But God awaits our pray'r of faith
that cries 'Your will be done.'

-----

Awake, O church arise and pray.
complaining words discard.
The Spirit comes to fill your mouth
with truth, His mighty sword.
Go place your feet on Satan's Ground
and there proclaim Christ's name.
In step with heaven's armies march!
To conquer and to reign!

-----

Ladies: Now in our hearts and on our lips
the word of faith is near,
 Let heaven's will on earth be done
let heaven flow from here.
Men:Come blend your prayers
with Jesus' own before the Father's throne.
And as the incense clouds ascend
God's holy fire rains down.

-----

Soon comes the day when with a shout
King Jesus shall appear.
And with Him all the church from ev-
ery age shall fill the air.
The brightness of His coming shall
consume the lawless one.
As with a word the breath of God
tears down his rebel throne.

-----

One body here by heav'n inspired,
We seek prophetic power;
In Christ agreed one heart and voice,
To speak this day this hour,
In every place where chaos rules
And evil forces brood;
Let Jesus' voice speak like the roar
of a great multitude.
