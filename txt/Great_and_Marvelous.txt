# Revelation 15:3-4 (Great and Marvelous)

Great and marvelous are your works,
LORD God Almighty. 
Just and true are your ways,
King of the Ages. 
Who will not fear you, O LORD,
and bring glory to your name?
For you alone are holy.

-----

All nations will come
and worship before you,
for your righteous acts have been revealed.
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah. 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah.
