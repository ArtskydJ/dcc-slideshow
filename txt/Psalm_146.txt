# Psalm 146

Hallelujah! praise Jehovah!
O my soul, Jehovah praise!
While I live I'll praise Jehovah,
praise my God through all my days.

-----

Put no confidence in princes,
nor for help on man depend;
he shall die, to dust returning,
and his purposes shall end.

-----

Happy is the man that chooses
Jacob's God to be his aid;
he is blessed whose hope of blessing
on the LORD his God is stayed.

-----

He has made the earth and heaven,
seas, and all that they contain;
He will keep his truth forever,
rights of those oppressed maintain.

-----

Food Jehovah gives the hungry,
sight Jehovah gives the blind, 
Freedom gives He to the pris'ner,
cheer to those bowed down in mind. 

-----

Well Jehovah loves the righteous
to the stranger is a stay, 
Helps the fatherless and widow,
but subverts the sinner's way.

-----

Yea, Jehovah reigns forever,
through all ages He is King;
Even He, thy God, O Zion
to Jehovah praises sing!
