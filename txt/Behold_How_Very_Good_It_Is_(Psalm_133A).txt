# Behold How Very Good It Is (Psalm 133)

Behold how very good it is,
a pleasant thing to see;
when brothers join to live as one
in peace and unity!

-----

Yes, it is like the precious oil
poured out upon the head,
Which, running down from Aaron's beard,
upon his garments spread.

-----

It is as though Mount Hermon's dew
on Zion's hills descends;
For there the Lord bestowed the gift
of life that never ends.
