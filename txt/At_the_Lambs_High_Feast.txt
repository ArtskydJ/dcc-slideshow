# At the Lambs High Feast We Sing

At the Lamb's high feast we sing,
praise to our victorious King,
Who hath washed us in the tide
flowing from His piercÃ¨d side;

-----

Praise we Him, whose love divine
gives His sacred blood for wine,
Gives His body for the feast,
Christ the Victim, Christ the Priest.

-----

Where the Paschal blood is poured,
death's dark angel sheathes his sword;
Israel's hosts triumphant go
through the wave that drowns the foe.

-----

Praise we Christ, whose blood was shed,
paschal Victim, paschal Bread;
With sincerity and love
Eat we manna from above.

-----

Mighty Victim from the sky,
Hell's fierce powers beneath Thee lie;
Thou hast conquered in the fight,
Thou hast brought us life and light;

-----

Now no more can death appall,
now no more the grave enthrall;
Thou hast opened Paradise,
and in Thee Thy saints shall rise.

-----

Paschal triumph, Easter joy,
only sin can this destroy;
From sin's death do Thou set free
souls reborn, O Lord, in Thee.

-----

Hymns of glory and of praise,
Father, to Thee we raise;
Risen Lord, all praise to Thee,
ever with the Spirit be.
