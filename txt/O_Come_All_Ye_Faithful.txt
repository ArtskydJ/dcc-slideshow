# O Come All Ye Faithful

O come, all ye faithful,
joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
come and behold him
born the King of angels!

-----

O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord!

-----

God of God,
Light of Light;
lo, he abhors not the virgin's womb: 
very God, begotten,
not created;

-----

O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord!

-----

Sing, choirs of angels;
sing in exultation,
sing, all ye citizens of heav'n above;
glory to God,
glory in the highest!

> *all?

O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord!

-----

Yea, Lord, we greet thee,
born that happy morning:
Jesus, to thee be all glory giv'n:
Word of the Father,
late in flesh appearing!

-----

O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord!

-----

We come with praise and worship to Christ our Lord!
