# Blest the Man That Fears Jehovah

Blest the man that fears Jehovah, walking ever in his ways;
By your toil you shall be prospered and be happy all your days.

-----

In your wife you shall have gladness, she shall fill your home with good, 
happy in her loving service and the joys of motherhood.

-----

Joyful children, sons and daughters, shall about your table meet,
Olive plants, in strength and beauty, full of hope and promise sweet.

-----

Lo, on him that fears Jehovah shall this blessedness attend,
For Jehovah out of Zion shall to you his blessing send.

-----

You shall see God's kingdom prosper all your days, till life shall cease,
You shall see your children's children; on your people, Lord be peace.

> From Psalm 12B The Psalter, 1912; mod. GALILEE 8.7.8.7. William H. Jude. 1887
