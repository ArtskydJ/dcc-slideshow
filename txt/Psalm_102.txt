# Psalm 102 

But You, Jehovah, shall endure
From age to age eternally, 
And to all generations sure
Shall your memorial ever be,
Shall Your memorial ever be.

-----

You shall arise and mercy yet
You unto Zion shall extend. 
The time has come which You have set,
When You will favor to her send,
When You will favor to her send.

-----

Your saints take pleasure in her stones; Her very dust to them is dear. 
So heathen lands and kingly thrones
Jehovah's glorious name shall fear, Jehovah's glorious name shall fear.

-----

The LORD in glory has appeared,
Has built up Zion strong and fair, 
And He the destitute has heard,
Has not despised their humble prayer. 
 Has not despised their humble prayer. 

-----

Lest coming ages should forget,
This wondrous work shall men record, 
And peoples uncreated yet
Shall Praise and magnify the LORD.
Shall Praise and magnify the LORD.

-----

He from His holy place looked down;
The LORD viewed earth from heaven high, 
To hear the pris'ner's mourning groan,
And free them that are doomed to die.
And free them that are doomed to die.

-----

That Zion may the Lord's name tell, Jerusalem His praise record, 
When gathered are the peoples all
And kingdoms join to serve the LORD. And kingdoms join to serve the LORD.
