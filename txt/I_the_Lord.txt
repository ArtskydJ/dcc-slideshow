# I, The Lord

I, the Lord of sea and sky,
I have heard My people cry. 
All who dwell in dark and sin
My hand will save. 

-----

I, who made the stars of night,
I will make their darkness bright. 
I will send My light to them.
A-rise and shine.

-----

For Your light came
and the glory of the Lord
is risen upon you. 
Behold darkness on the peoples
and thick darkness over all the earth. 

-----

I, the Lord of snow and rain,
I have borne My people's pain. 
I have wept for love of them.
They turn away. 

-----

I will break their hearts of stone,
Give them hearts for love alone. 
I will speak My word to them.
Arise and shine. 

-----

I, the Lord of wind and flame,
I will tend the poor and lame. 
I will set a feast for them.
My hand will save. 

-----

Finest bread I will provide,
Till their hearts be satisfied. 
I will give My life to them.
Arise and shine 

-----

And the Lord will
arise o'er you. 
And His glory will
be seen on you. 

-----

And the Gentiles
Come to Your light, 
And the Kings
to brightness of Your dawn. 
Rise and shine.
Rise and shine.
