# Psalm 96:1-6 

O sing a new song to the Lord,
let all the earth sing to the Lord.
Sing to the Lord and bless His name,
and His salvation loud proclaim!

-----

Proclaim this good news constantly,
His glory and His majesty;
His miracles to all declare
throughout the nations everywhere.
Throughout the nations everywhere.

-----

Behold the greatness of the Lord!
So greatly should He be adored,
and feared above all else by far,
for Gentile gods mere idols are.

-----

Not so the Lord! He heaven made,
and there before Him is displayed
all splendor, majesty and grace;
all strength dwells in His holy place.
All strength dwells in His holy place.
