# Jesus, with Thy Church Abide

Jesus, with thy Church abide,
be her Savior, Lord, and guide;
While on earth her faith is tried:
we beseech Thee, hear us.

-----

Keep her life and doctrine pure,
help her, patient, to endure;
Trusting in Thy promise sure:
we beseech Thee, hear us.

-----

May she one in doctrine be,
one in truth and charity,
Winning all to faith in Thee:
we beseech Thee, hear us.

-----

Save her love from growing cold,
make her watchmen strong and bold.
Fence her round, thy peaceful fold:
we beseech Thee, hear us.

-----

May she holy triumphs win,
overthrow the hosts of sin,
Gather all the nations in:
we beseech Thee, hear us.
