# Steps a Man Takes

Steps a man takes are established
by the Lord for His delight. 
If he stumbles, he'll not fall down,
by the Lord his hands held tight. 
Though once young, I am quite old now,
yet throughout the life I've led 
I've not seen the just forsaken
nor their children begging bread.

-----

His descendants are a blessing
through the day he lends and gives
turn from evil; practice goodness
that you may forever live.
For the Lord, who loves true justice,
will not leave His godly ones;
They will be preserved forever,
while cut off are sinners' sons.

-----

In the land the righteous settle,
dwelling in it endlessly,
for the whole land in the future
their inheritance shall be.
Words of wisdom speaks the righteous,
justice comes forth from his lips;
since God's law within his heart is,
in his steps he never slips.
