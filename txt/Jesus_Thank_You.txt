# Jesus, Thank You

The mystr'y of the cross I cannot comprehend, The agonies of Calvary.
You the perfect holy One crushed Your Son, Drank the bitter cup reserved for me.

-----

Your blood has washed away my sin,
Jesus thank You;
The Father's wrath completely satisfied,
Jesus thank You;
Once Your enemy now seated at Your table, Jesus thank You.

-----

By Your perfect sacrifice I've been brought near;
Your enemy You've made Your friend.
Pouring out the riches of Your glorious grace;
Your mercy and your kindness know no end.

-----

Your blood has washed away my sin,
Jesus thank You;
The Father's wrath completely satisfied,
Jesus thank You;
Once Your enemy now seated at Your table, Jesus thank You.

-----

Lover of my soul I want to live for You,
Lover of my soul I want to live for You.
Lover of my soul I want to live for You,
Lover of my soul I want to live for You.

-----

Your blood has washed away my sin,
Jesus thank You;
The Father's wrath completely satisfied,
Jesus thank You;
Once Your enemy now seated at Your table, Jesus thank You.

-----

Your blood has washed away my sin,
Jesus thank You;
The Father's wrath completely satisfied,
Jesus thank You;
Once Your enemy now seated at Your table, Jesus thank You.
