# Come Ye Souls By Sin Afflicted

Come, ye souls by sin afflicted, Bowed with fruitless sorrow down; 
By the broken law convicted, through the cross behold the crown; 
look to Jesus; mercy flows through Him alone.

-----

Take His easy yoke and wear it; Love will make obedience sweet; 
Christ will give you strength to bear it, While His wisdom guides your feet 
Safe to glory, where His ransomed captives meet.

-----

Blessed are the eyes that see Him, Blest the ears that hear His voice; 
Blessed are the souls that trust Him, And in Him alone rejoice; 
His commandments then become their happy choice.

-----

Sweet as home to pilgrims weary, Light to newly opened eyes, 
Or full springs in deserts dreary Is the rest the cross supplies; 
All who taste it shall to rest immortal rise.
