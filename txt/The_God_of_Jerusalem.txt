# The God Of Jerusalem (Deut. 33.26-27)

There is none like the God of Jerusalem,
 he descends from the heavens above
with majestic splendor to help us
 with his strength, with his might,
 with his power."

-----

Eternal God, our Refuge,
 Eternal God, our Rock.
We find rest in the God of Jerusalem;
 in his everlasting arms.

-----

There is none like the God of Jerusalem,
 he descends from the heavens above
with majestic splendor to help us
 with his strength, with his might,
 with his power;
with his strength, with his might,
 with his power.
