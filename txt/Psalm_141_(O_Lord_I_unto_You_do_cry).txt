# Psalm 141

O Lord, I unto You do cry;
now come to me with speed. 
Whenever I upon You call,
unto my voice give heed! 
As incense let my prayer be
accepted in Your eyes. 
May raising of my hands be like
the evening sacrifice.

-----

Upon my lips' door keep a watch;
O Lord, my mouth do guard.
O let not any evil thing
then turn away my heart.
Let me not practice wickedness
with men of evil deed, 
And do not ever let me on
their delicacies feed.

-----

O let a righteous man strike me,
in kindness to correct.
It's oil upon my head. So let
my head not it reject;
For still I pray against their deeds
of sin. Their judges were 
thrown down against the rock. They'll hear
my words which sweet truth bear.

-----

As when one ploughs and breaks up earth,
our bones are scattered at 
the grave's mouth, but, O sovereign Lord,
my eyes on You are set. 
In You I refuge take. Do not
my soul permit to be 
defenseless, keep me from the jaws
of traps they've set for me;

-----

And from the snares, which those do
iniquity have set, 
let me pass, safe, while wicked men
fall into their own net.
