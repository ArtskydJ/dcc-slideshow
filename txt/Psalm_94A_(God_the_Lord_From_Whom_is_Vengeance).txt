# God the Lord From Whom is Vengeance

God the Lord, from whom is vengeance,
God, avenger, O shine forth!
Judge of all the earth, O rise up!
 Pay the proud what they are worth.

-----

O Lord, how long will the wicked,
how long will the wicked gloat?
From their mouths they pour out violence,
of themselves all wicked boast.

-----

They, O Lord, beat down Your people,
and Your heritage oppress.
They kill foreigner and widow;
they have slain the fatherless.

-----

They have said, "The Lord does not see,
Jacob's God has closed His eyes."
Understand, you senseless people;
when, O fools, will you be wise?

-----

Who the ear made, can He hear not?
Who formed eyes, can he not see?
Who warns nations, will He strike not?
Who men teaches, know not He?

-----

All the thoughts of men the Lord knows;
knows that but a breath are they.
Blessed the man whom You reprove, Lord;
Through Your law You point his way.

-----

Give him rest from days of trouble
till the wicked are brought down.
For the Lord stays with His people,
He will not forsake His own.

-----

Righteous judgments will be rendered,
justice will return again;
Those of upright heart will follow
in the way of justice then.
