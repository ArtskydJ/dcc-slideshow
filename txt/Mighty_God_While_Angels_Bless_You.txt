# Mighty God, While Angels Bless You

Mighty God, while angels bless you,
may a mortal sing your Name?
Lord of men as well as angels,
you are every creature's theme.
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, Amen.

-----

Lord of every land and nation,
ancient of eternal days,
sounded through the wide creation
be your just and lawful praise. 
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, Amen.

-----

For the grandeur of your nature,
grand beyond a seraph's thought,
for created works of power,
works with skill and kindness wrought. 
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, Amen.

-----

But your rich, your free redemption,
dark through brightness all along,
thought is poor, and poor expression,
who dare sing that wondrous song? 
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, Amen.

-----

Brightness of the Father's glory,
shall your praise unuttered lie?
Fly, my tongue, such guilty silence,
sings the Lord who came to die. 
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, Amen.

-----

From the highest throne in glory
to the cross of deepest woe,
all to ransom guilty captives,
flow my praise, forever flow! 
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, Amen.
