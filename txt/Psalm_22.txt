# Psalm 22 

My God, why have you left me?
Why do my cries not help?
I cry by day—no answer—
and night—but get no rest. 
But you, O Lord, are holy,
enthroned on Israel's praise.
In you our fathers trusted
and you delivered them. 

-----

They cried to you; you saved them;
you did not fail their trust.
But I'm a worm, not human,
scorned and despised by all. 
All who look at me taunt me,
they laugh and shake their heads.
"He trusted God, let God save,
for he delights in him." 

-----

My strength is like spilled water,
my bones are out of joint;
my heart in me is melted
like wax within my breast; 
my strength's dry as a potsherd,
my tongue sticks in my mouth.
In the dust I'm left lying
as if I'm good as dead. 

-----

Yes, dogs are all around me—
a gang of evil ones.
They tear at me like lions,
they pierce my hands and feet. 
My bones can all be counted.
Foes stare and gloat o'er me,
they gamble for my clothing,
and each one takes a share.
