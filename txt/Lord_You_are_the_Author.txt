# Lord, You are the Author

Lord, you are the author of my life,
you have begun a work in me,
you have predestined me to do your perfect will.

-----

Lord, you are the lord of all my days,
you are the lord of all my nights,
you have chosen me to carry forth your word.

-----

And Lord finish in me what you've begun,
guide me by your mighty hand--- Lord.
Let me trust in you.

-----

So Lord, let me seek your holy face,
may I always walk with you--- Lord.
Let me trust in you. 
And let your will be done.

-----

# Be Thou My Vision

Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;
naught be all else to me, save that thou art. 
Thou my best thought by day or by night,
waking or sleeping, thy presence my light. 

-----

Be thou my wisdom, and thou my true word;
I ever with thee and thou with me, Lord. 
Thou my great Father, I thy true son;
thou in me dwelling, and I with thee one. 

-----

Be thou my battle shield, sword for my fight;
be thou my dignity, thou my delight. 
Thou my soul's shelter, thou my high tow'r,
raise thou me heav'n-ward, O Pow'r of my pow'r.

-----

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise;
thou mine inheritance, now and always: 
thou and thou only, first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure thou art.

-----

# Lord, You are the Author

So Lord, let me seek your holy face,
may I always walk with you--- Lord. Let me trust in you. 

-----

And Lord finish in me what you've begun,
guide me by your mighty hand--- Lord.
Let me trust in you.

-----

Lord may your kingdom come, 
and let your will be done,
as it is in heaven above.
