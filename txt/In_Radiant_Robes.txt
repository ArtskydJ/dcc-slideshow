# In Radiant Robes

In radiant robes of holiness
bring worship to the LORD.
All earth, before him stand in awe,
proclaim, "The LORD is King!"

-----

The world stands firm and will not move;
with justice he'll judge all.
Let heav'ns be glad, let earth rejoice
with seas and all they hold.

-----

Let everything in every field
In jubilation join.
Then woods and trees will shout for joy,
and sing before the LORD.
