# Psalm 111

O give the Lord wholehearted praise,
to Him thanksgiving I will bring;
With all His people I will raise
my voice and of His glory sing.
His saints delight to search and trace
His mighty works and wondrous ways;
Majestic glory, boundless grace,
and righteousness His work displays.

-----

The wondrous works that God has wrought
His people ever keep in mind;
His works with grace and mercy fraught,
revealing that the Lord is kind.
God's promise shall forever stand,
He cares for those who trust His word;
Upon His saints His mighty hand
the wealth of nations has conferred.

-----

His works are true and just indeed,
His precepts are forever sure;
In truth and righteousness decreed,
they shall forever more endure.
From Him His saints' redemption came;
His cov'nant sure no change can know;
Let all revere His holy name
in heav'n above and earth below.

-----

In reverence and in godly fear
man finds the gate to wisdom's ways;
The wise His holy name revere;
Through endless ages sound His praise.
