# Awake, O Israel

O, hallelujah,
O, hallelujah, hallelujah, praise the Lord! 
O, hallelujah,
O, hallelujah, hallelujah, praise the Lord! 

-----

You are my chosen,
for I have sought you;
you are graven on my hand;
and I will gather all those I've scattered,
they shall come back to their land. 

-----

O, hallelujah,
O, hallelujah, hallelujah, praise the Lord! 
O, hallelujah,
O, hallelujah, hallelujah, praise the Lord! 
Hallelujah, praise the Lord!
Hallelujah, praise the Lord

# Jesus, Thy Blood and Righteousness 

Jesus, thy blood and righteousness
my beauty are, my glorious dress; 
midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,
with joy shall I lift up my head.

-----

Bold shall I stand in thy great day;
for who aught to my charge shall lay?
Fully absolved through these I am
from sin and fear, from guilt and shame.

-----

When from the dust of death I rise
to claim my mansion in the skies,
ev'n then this shall be all my plea,
Jesus hath lived, hath died, for me.

-----

Jesus, be endless praise to thee,
whose boundless mercy hath for me—
for me a full atonement made,
an everlasting ransom paid.

-----

O let the dead now hear thy voice;
now bid thy banished ones rejoice; 
their beauty this, their glorious dress,
Jesus, thy blood and righteousness.
