in the heavens with radiant signs
evermore your glory shines.

how great your name! 
Yours the name of matchless worth,
excellent in all the earth.

Infant voices chant your praise,
telling of your glorious ways;

mighty enemies to still. 
How great your name!

Moon and stars in shining height
nightly tell their Maker's might; 
when I view the heavens afar,
then I know how small we are. 
How great your name!

in your love and tender care, 
raised to an exalted height,
crowned with honor in your sight!

With dominion crowned, we stand
o'er the creatures of your hand; 
all to us subjection yield,
in the sea and air and field. 
How great your name!

Lord, our Lord, in all the earth,
how great your name! 
Yours the name of matchless worth,
excellent in all the earth.
