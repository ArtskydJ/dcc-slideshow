# Crown Him with Many Crowns

Crown him with many crowns,
the Lamb upon his throne. 
Hark! how the heav'nly anthem drowns
all music but its own!

-----

Awake, my soul, and sing
of him who died for thee, 
and hail him as thy matchless King
through all eternity.

-----

Majesty Lord of all!
Let every throne before him fall!
The King of kings, O come adore
our God who reigns forevermore!

-----

All hail Redeemer, hail,
for He has died for me!
His praise and glory shall not fail
through-out eternity! 

-----

Praise God who reigns forevermore!
You're the God who reigns forevermore!

-----

Crown him the Lord of Life,
who triumphed o'er the grave; 
who rose victorious in the strife
for those he came to save.

-----

His glories now we sing,
who died and rose on high,
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die.

-----

Crown him the Lord of Peace,
whose power a scepter sways
from pole to pole, that wars may cease,
and all be prayer and praise:

-----

His reign shall know no end
his triumph will be sure
till every nation tribe and tongue
their tribute to him send.
Be thou, O Lord, thro' endless days
adored and magnified!
