No other name

no other name
but the name of the Lord;

-----

no other name
but the name of Jesus 
is worthy of glory,
and worthy of honor,
and worthy of power and all praise.

No other name

no other name
but the name of the Lord;

-----

no other name
but the name of Jesus 
is worthy of glory,
and worthy of honor,
and worthy of power and all praise. 

-----

His name is exalted
far above the earth, 
his name
is high above the heavens; 

-----

his name is exalted
far above the earth, 
give glory
and honor
and praise unto His name. 

-----

No other name
but the name of Jesus, no other name
but the name of the Lord; 

-----

no other name
but the name of Jesus is worthy of glory,
and worthy of honor,
and worthy of power and all praise.
