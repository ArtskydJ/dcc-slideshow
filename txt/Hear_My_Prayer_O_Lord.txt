# Hear My Prayer, O Lord 

Hear my prayer, O Lord,
from the ends of the earth I cry.
Your peace will lead me to
the Rock that is higher than I.

Hear my prayer, O Lord,
from the ends of the earth I cry.
Your peace will lead me to
the Rock that is higher than I.

-----

For you have been my strength
in times of trouble,
a tower above my enemies.
And Lord, I will abide with you forever
in the shelter of your wings.

-----

For you, O Lord,
have heard my vows and given me
the heritage of those who fear your name.
So I will sing a song of praise to your name
daily will I pay my vows.

-----

Hear my prayer, O Lord,
from the ends of the earth I cry.
Your peace will lead me to
the Rock that is higher than I,
the Rock that is higher than I,
the Rock that is higher than I.
