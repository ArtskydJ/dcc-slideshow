# My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less

My hope is built on nothing less
than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
but wholly lean on Jesus' name.

-----

On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
 all other ground is sinking sand.

-----

When darkness veils His lovely face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
He anchor holds within the veil.

-----

On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
 all other ground is sinking sand.

-----

His oath, His covenant, His blood
support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope to stay.

-----

On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
 all other ground is sinking sand.

-----

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
O may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
faultless to stand before the throne.

-----

On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,
 all other ground is sinking sand.

> William Bradbury, 1863
