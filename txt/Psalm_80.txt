# Psalm 80

Hear, O hear us, Israel's Shepherd,
Who drives forth Joseph like a flock!
From the cherubim, O shine forth!
Rise in valor that we be saved!

-----

So arise in sight of Ephraim,
And Manasseh and Benjamin!
God, we pray, O turn us! Bring us back!
Make Your face shine, and we are saved!

-----

O how long, LORD God of Armies,
Burns Your wrath at Your people's prayer!
With the bread of tears You feed them,
And full measure of tears they drink!

-----

Strife You make us to our neighbors,
And our foes laugh at us in scorn!
God of Armies, turn us! Bring us back!
Make Your face shine, and we are saved!

-----

You brought forth a vine from Egypt,
And to plant it drove nations out.
You made room to root it deeply,
And it flourished and filled the land.

-----

Then its shadow wrapped the mountains,
And its boughs hid the cedars tall!
To the sea it thrust great branches forth.
And young shoots to the mighty stream!

-----

Why have You torn down its fences?
It is plucked by each passing hand!
Forest boars have gnawed upon it,
And wild creatures have pastured there!

-----

Turn again, O God of Armies!
Look from heav'n! Visit this Your vine!
So uphold what Your right hand did plant,
And the son You raised up in strength!

-----

It is burned and hewn in pieces-
By Your frown will they be destroyed!
Lay Your hand on him You favored,
Son of man that You raised in strength!

-----

Then from You we will not wander;
Make us live! We will call Your name!
O LORD God of Armies, turn us back!
Make Your face shine, and we are saved!
