# Shout, For the Blessed Jesus Reigns

Shout, for the blessed Jesus reigns;
through distant lands his triumphs spread
and sinners, freed from endless pains,
own him their Savior and their Head.

-----

He calls his chosen from afar,
they all at Zion's gates arrive;
those who were dead in sin before
by sovereign grace are made alive.

-----

Gentiles and Jews his laws obey;
nations remote their offerings bring,
and unconstrained their homage pay
to their exalted God and King.

-----

O may his holy church increase,
His Word and Spirit still prevail,
while angels celebrate His praise,
and saints his growing glories hail.

-----

Loud hallelujahs to the Lamb,
from all below, and all above!
In lofty songs exalt his Name,
in songs as lasting as his love.
