# Grace Flows Down / Amazing Grace

Amazing grace,
how sweet the sound;
amazing love, now flowing down 
from hands and feet
that were nailed to the tree
as grace flows down and covers me. 

-----

It covers me,
it covers me,
it covers me,
and covers me.

-----

Twas grace that taught
my heart to fear,
and grace my fears, my fears relieved; 
how precious did
that grace appear
the hour I first, I first believed! 

-----

Amazing grace,
now flowing down,
it covers me,
amazing grace.

-----

Through many dangers,
through toils and snares,
I have already, already come; 
'tis grace has brought
me safe thus far,
and grace will lead, will lead me home. 

-----

And when this flesh
and heart shall fail,
and mortal life, this life shall cease, 
I shall possess
within the veil
a life of joy, of joy and peace.

-----

When we've been there
ten thousand years,
bright shining as, bright as the sun, 
we've no less days
to sing God's praise
than when we've first, we've first begun.
