# Children of the Heavenly Father

Children of the heav'nly Father safely in his bosom gather; nestling bird nor star in heaven such a refuge e'er was given.

-----

God his own doth tend and nourish, in his holy courts they flourish; from all evil things he spares them, in his mighty arms he hears them.

-----

Neither life nor death shall ever from the Lord his children sever; unto them his grace he showeth, and their sorrows all he knoweth.

-----

Praise the Lord in joyful numbers, your Protector never slumbers; at the will of your Defender every foeman must surrender.

-----

Though he giveth or he taketh, God his children ne'er forsaketh; his the loving purpose solely to preserve them pure and holy.

-----

More secure is no one ever than the loved ones of the Savior; not yon star on high abiding nor the bird in home-nest hiding.
