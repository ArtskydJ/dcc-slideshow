# O God, Be My Strength

O God be my strength
through my doubt and my fear.
O God be my comfort
when darkness is near.
O Lord of all hope
you're my Saviour and guide.
O Lord have mercy on me.

-----

O God of all mercy
and God of all grace
whose infinite gift
was to die in my place.
Eternal Creator,
Redeemer, and friend
O Lord have mercy on me.

-----

O God of all power
invisible King, 
restorer of man
my life I bring.
O Lord of my heart
grant your peace now I pray.
O Lord have mercy on me.
