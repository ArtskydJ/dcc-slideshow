# We Will Rejoice

We will rejoice in you and be glad.
We will extol your love more than wine;
draw us into heaven to your upper chambers,
we will rejoice in you and be glad.

-----

Indeed the Lord has proclaimed to the world:
say to the daughter of Zion this word: 
Surely your salvation and reward is coming
and you shall be
the Redeemed of the LORD.

-----

You shall be called --- Forsaken no more;
nor shall your land be Desolate called;
Hephzibah and Beulah
will your land be called now
for I the LORD am delighted in you.

-----

Go through! Go through the gates and prepare. Build up! Build up the highway of God! 
Lifting up a banner for the foreign peoples,
they shall be called:
the Redeemed of the LORD,
the Holy People, the City of God. 
We will rejoice in you and be glad.
