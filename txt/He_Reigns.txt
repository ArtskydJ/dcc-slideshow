# He Reigns

Holy, holy, holy
is our Lord God Almighty. 
He alone is worthy,
awesome Lord, Mighty King. 

-----

He reigns through all the universe,
his glory covers all the earth
his pow'r displayed in mighty works,
and we proclaim him as our Lord and King.

-----

Worthy, worthy, worthy
is the Lamb that was slain. 
Reigns in pow'r and glory,
bears the Name above all names. 

-----

He reigns through all the universe,
his glory covers all the earth,
his pow'r displayed in mighty works,
and we proclaim him as our Lord and King.

He reigns through all the universe,
his glory covers all the earth,
his pow'r displayed in mighty works,
and we proclaim him as our Lord and King.
And we proclaim him as our Lord and King.
And we proclaim him as our Lord and King.
