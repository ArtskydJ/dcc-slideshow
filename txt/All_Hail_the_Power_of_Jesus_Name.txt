# All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name

All hail the power of Jesus' Name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
bring forth the royal diadem,
and crown Him Lord of all;
bring forth the royal diadem,
and crown Him Lord of all.

Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God
who from His altar call;
extol the Stem of Jesse's rod,
and crown Him Lord of all;
extol the Stem of Jesse's rod,
and crown Him Lord of all.

-----

Ye seed of Israel's chosen race,
Ye ransomed of the fall,
hail Him who saves you by His grace,
and crown Him Lord of all;
hail Him who saves you by His grace,
and crown Him Lord of all.

-----

Let ev'ry kindred, ev'ry tribe,
on this terrestrial ball,
to Him all majesty ascribe,
and crown Him Lord of all;
to Him all majesty ascribe,
and crown Him Lord of all.

-----

O that with yonder sacred throng
we at His feet may fall;
we'll join the everlasting song,
and crown Him Lord of all;
we'll join the everlasting song,
and crown Him Lord of all.
