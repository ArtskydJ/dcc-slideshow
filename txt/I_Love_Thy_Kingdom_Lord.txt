# I Love Thy Kingdom Lord 

I love Thy kingdom, Lord,
the house of Thine abode,
The church our blessed Redeemer saved
with His own precious blood.

-----

I love Thy church, O God.
Her walls before Thee stand,
Dear as the apple of Thine eye,
and written on Thy hand.

-----

If e'er to bless Thy sons
my voice or hands deny,
These hands let useful skills forsake,
This voice in silence die.

-----

Should I with scoffers join
Her altars to abuse?
No! Better far my tongue were dumb,
my hand its skill should lose.

-----

For her my tears shall fall
for her my prayers ascend,
To her my cares and toils be given
till toils and cares shall end.

-----

Beyond my highest joy
I prize her heavenly ways,
Her sweet communion, solemn vows,
her hymns of love and praise.

-----

Jesus, Thou Friend divine,
our Savior and our King,
Thy hand from every snare and foe
shall great deliverance bring.

-----

Sure as Thy truth shall last,
to Zion shall be given
The brightest glories earth can yield
and brighter bliss of Heaven.
