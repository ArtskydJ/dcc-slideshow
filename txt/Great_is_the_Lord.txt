# Great is the Lord

Great is the Lord,
he is holy and just,
by his power we trust in his love.
Great is the Lord,
he is faithful and true,
by his mercy he proves he is love.

-----

Great is the Lord and worthy of glory,
great is the Lord and worthy of praise.
Great is the Lord, now lift up your voice,
now lift up your voice:
Great is the Lord! Great is the Lord!

-----

King of all Kings,
and the Lord of all Lords,
through the ages your fame shall endure.
Decked like a groom
in your chamber above,
you are mighty yet tender in love.

-----

Filled with all pow'r,
yet flowing with mercy. 
Fearful in wrath,
yet gracious and kind. 

-----

Worthy of fear,
yet stirring up faith,
and filling with hope:
great are you Lord! 
Great are you Lord!
