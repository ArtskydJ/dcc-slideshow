# All Heaven Declares

All heav'n declares
the glory of the risen Lord. 
Who can compare
with the beauty of the Lord? 

-----

Men: Forever He will be,
Women: Forever He will be
Men: the Lamb upon the throne.
Women: the Lamb upon the throne.
Men: I gladly bow my knee
Women: I gladly bow my knee
All: and worship Him alone. 

-----

I will proclaim
the glory of the risen Lord, 
who once was slain
to reconcile man to God. 

-----

Men: Forever You will be,
Women: Forever You will be
Men: the Lamb upon the throne.
Women: the Lamb upon the throne.
Men: I gladly bow my knee
Women: I gladly bow my knee
All: and worship You alone.

-----

Men: Forever You will be,
Women: Forever You will be
Men: the Lamb upon the throne.
Women: the Lamb upon the throne.
Men: I gladly bow my knee
Women: I gladly bow my knee
All: and worship You alone.
And worship You alone.
And worship You alone.
