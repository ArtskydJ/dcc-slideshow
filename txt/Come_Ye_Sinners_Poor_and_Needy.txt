# Come, Ye Sinners, Poor and Needy

Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched,
weak and wounded, sick and sore; 
Jesus, ready, stands to save you,
full of pity, love and power. 

-----

Come ye thirsty, come, and welcome,
God's free bounty glorify: 
True belief and true repentance,
every grace that brings you nigh. 

-----

Come, ye weary, heavy laden,
lost and ruined by the fall; 
If you tarry till you're better,
you will never come at all. 

-----

Let not conscience make you linger,
nor of fitness fondly dream; 
All the fitness He requireth
is to feel your need of Him. 

-----

Lo! The Incarnate God, ascended;
pleads the merit of His blood. 
Venture on Him; venture wholly,
let no other trust intrude. 
None but Jesus, none but Jesus
can do helpless sinners good.
