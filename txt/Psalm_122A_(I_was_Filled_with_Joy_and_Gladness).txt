# Psalm 122

I was filled with joy and gladness
when I heard them say to me;
let us make our pilgrim journey,
then the Lord's house we will see.
We were standing! We were standing!
In your gates, Jerusalem
in your gates, Jerusalem!

-----

In Jerusalem, built securely,
there the tribes the Lord's tribes go.
This is Israel's obligation,
to the Lord's name thanks they show.
There, for justice, there, for justice,
stand the thrones of David's house
Stand the thrones of David's house.

-----

For Jerusalem, built securely,
there the tribes the Lord's tribes go.
All the ones who truly love you,
may they prosper and increase.
Peace and safety, peace and safety
be within your walls and towers,
be within your walls and towers.

-----

I will say, may peace be with you!
For my friends and brothers' sake.
For the Lord's house, our God's temple,
this my purpose I will make:
Your well being, your well being,
I will seek with all my heart,
I will seek with all my heart.
