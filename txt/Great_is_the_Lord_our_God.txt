# Great Is the LORD Our God (Psalm 48) 

Great is the LORD our God,
and greatly to be praised.
Upon a hill God's city stands
in glorious beauty raised--
his holy mountain high,
the city of our King,
the joy of all the earth below.
In praise of God we sing.

-----

God makes his city strong
by living in her halls. 
When kings join forces and advance,
they marvel at her walls.
God scatters those around
whose pride makes them so sure.
As we have heard, so have we seen:
God's city is secure.

-----

Within your temple, LORD,
in your most holy place,
we on your lovingkindness dwell,
the wonders of your grace.
Your people sing your praise
where'er your name is known;
by every deed your hand has done
your righteousness is shown.

-----

Let Zion now rejoice
and all her people sing;
let them with thankfulness proclaim
the judgments of their King.
Mount Zion's walls behold,
about her ramparts go,
and number all the lofty towers
that guard her from the foe.

-----

Observe her palaces,
mark her defenses well,
that to the children following you
her glories you may tell.
For God as our own God,
forever will abide,
and till life's journey close in death
will be our faithful guide.
