# I've Found the Pearl of Greatest Price

I've found the Pearl of greatest price!
My heart doth sing for joy;
And sing I must, for Christ is mine;
Christ shall my song employ.

I've found the Pearl of greatest price!
My heart doth sing for joy;
And sing I must, for Christ is mine;
Christ shall my song employ.

Christ is my Prophet, Priest and King;
a Prophet full of light,
my great High Priest before the throne,
my King of heav'nly might.

I've found the Pearl of greatest price,
My heart doth sing for joy;
And sing I must, for Christ is mine;
Christ shall my song employ.

For He indeed is Lord of lords,
and He the King of kings;
He is the Sun of righteousness,
with healing in His wings.

I've found the Pearl of greatest price,
My heart doth sing for joy;
And sing I must, for Christ is mine;
Christ shall my song employ.

Christ is my Peace; He died for me,
for me He shed His blood;
and as my wondrous Sacrifice,
offered Himself to God.

I've found the Pearl of greatest price,
My heart doth sing for joy;
And sing I must, for Christ is mine;
Christ shall my song employ.

-----

Christ Jesus is my all in all,
my comfort and my love; 
My life below, and He shall
be My joy and crown above.

-----

I've found the Pearl of greatest price!
My heart doth sing for joy;
And sing I must, for Christ is mine;
Christ shall my song employ.
