# Great is the Lord and Most Worthy of Praise

Great, 
is the Lord and most worthy of praise,
the city of our God, the holy place,
the joy of the whole earth. 

-----

Great,
is the Lord in whom we have the victory,
He aids us against the enemy,
we bow down on our knees.

-----

And Lord, 
we want to lift Your name on high; 
and Lord, 
we want to thank You,
for the works You've done in our lives. 

-----

And Lord, 
we trust in Your unfailing love;
for You alone are God eternal,
throughout earth and heaven above. 

-----

Praise, 
to the Father, Son and to the Holy Ghost,
ascribe all glory to the Lord of hosts. 
All honor to His name. 

-----

Praise, 
in the firmament above and in the earth,
let nothing rob our Lord of His great worth.
We bow down on our knees.

-----

And Lord,
we want to lift Your name on high; 
and Lord,
we want to thank You,
for the works You've done in our lives. 

-----

And Lord,
we trust in Your unfailing love;
for You alone are God eternal,
throughout earth and heaven above.

And Lord,

we want to thank You,
for the works You've done in our lives.

for You alone are God eternal,
throughout earth and heaven above.
