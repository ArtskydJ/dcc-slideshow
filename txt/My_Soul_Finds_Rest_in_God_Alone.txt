# Psalm 62A

My soul finds rest in God alone;
He my salvation is.
My only Rock, Salvation's fort;
I'm safe, for I am His

-----

How long will you press your attack
To make a person fall
As though against a sagging fence,
Against a leaning wall?

-----

They plot to bring his glory down,
In lies they take delight;
And while they bless him with their mouths,
Their hearts are filled with spite.

-----

My soul, find rest in God alone;
He's given hope to me.
He's my salvation, stronghold, rock;
Unshaken I shall be.

-----

In God alone my glory is,
And my salvation sure;
My rock of strength is found in God,
My refuge most secure.

-----

O people, at all times on Him
Rely with confidence;
Pour out your hearts in prayer to Him,
For God is our defense.

> Romans 8:25
