# Psalm 136:10-26

All Egypt's eldest sons he struck 
(Women: his love endures forever!)
And from their midst he Isr'el took, 
(his love endures forever!)
With mighty hand and arm stretched wide, 
(his love endures forever!)
The Sea of Reeds he did divide, 
(his love endures forever!)

-----

He brought all Isr'el through the Sea, 
(his love endures forever!)
Struck Pharaoh's army violently,
(his love endures forever!)
Through deserts he his people led, 
(his love endures forever!)
Kings great and mighty he struck dead, 
(his love endures forever!)

-----

First, Sihon of the Amorites, 
(his love endures forever!)
Then Og who ruled the Bashanites, 
(his love endures forever!)
To Isr'el he bequeathed their lands, 
(his love endures forever!)
His servant's own inheritance, 
(his love endures forever!)

-----

He thought of us when we were low, 
(his love endures forever!)
And rescued us from every foe, 
(his love endures forever!)
He food provides for all that live, 
(his love endures forever!)
Thanks to the God of heaven give, 
(his love endures forever!)
