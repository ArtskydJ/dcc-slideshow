# Call Jehovah Your Salvation (Psalm 91)

Call Jehovah your salvation,
rest beneath th'Almighty's shade.
In His secret habitation dwell,
and never be dismayed.
There no tumult shall alarm you,
you shall dread no hidden snare.
Guile nor violence can harm you,
in eternal safeguard there.

-----

From the sword at noonday wasting,
from the noisome pestilence,
In the depth of midnight blasting,
God shall be your sure defense.
He shall charge His angel legions
watch and ward over you to keep.
Though you walk through hostile regions, though in desert wilds you sleep.

-----

Since, with pure and firm affection,
you on God has set your love,
With the wings of His protection,
He will shield you from above.
You shall call on Him in trouble,
He will hearken, He will save.
Here for grief reward you double,
crown with life beyond the grave.
