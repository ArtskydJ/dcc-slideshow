# How Deep the Father's Love for Us

How deep the Father's love for us,
how vast beyond all measure
That he should give his only son
to make a wretch his treasure.

-----

How great the pain of searing loss. 
The Father turns his face away, 
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
bring many sons to glory.

-----

Behold the man upon a cross,
my sin upon his shoulders.
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
call out among the scoffers.

-----

It was my sin that held him there
until it was accomplished;
His dying breath has brought me life. 
I know that it is finished.

-----

I will not boast in anything;
no gifts, no power, no wisdom.
But I will boast in Jesus Christ;
his death and resurrection.

-----

Why should I gain from his reward?
I cannot give an answer. 
But this I know with all my heart,
his wounds have paid my ransom.
