# Soldiers of Christ, Arise

Soldiers of Christ, arise,
and put your armor on. 
Strong in the strength which God supplies
through His eternal Son. 
Strong in the Lord of Hosts,
and in His mighty pow'r, 
who in the strength of Jesus trusts
is more than conqueror.

-----

Stand then in His great might,
with all His strength endued; 
but take, to arm you for the fight,
the panoply* of God. 
Leave no unguarded place,
no weakness of the soul; 
take ev'ry virtue, ev'ry grace,
and fortify the whole.

> *panoply means complete armor or full defense of a soldier.

-----

To keep your armor bright,
attend with constant care; 
still walking in your Captain's sight,
and watching unto prayer. 
From strength to strength go on;
wrestle and fight and pray; 
tread all the pow'rs of darkness down,
and win the well-fought day.
