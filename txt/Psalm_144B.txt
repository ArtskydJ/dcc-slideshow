# Psalm 144B

O God, in praise to you,
a new song I will sing;
and with a ten stringed harp
Your praise I'll sing aloud.
For He salvation gives to kings;
His servant David He will help
and keep him from the cruel sword.

-----

O rescue me and save;
grant me deliverance
from out of alien hands,
the grip of foreign powers.
The ones whose mouth speaks what is false
the ones whose right hand is the same,
a right hand of deceitfulness.

-----

O may our sons like plants
grow sturdy in their youth;
and may our daughters be
like palace cornerstones.
May gathered crops fill up our barns
and all our flocks be multiplied
by thousands and ten thousands more.

-----

O may our herds increase
without distress or loss;
and may our streets be free
of outcry and of strife.
Behold how blessed such people are!
O happy people who can say
they have the LORD to be their God.
