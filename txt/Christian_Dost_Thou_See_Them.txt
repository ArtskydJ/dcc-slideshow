# Christian, Dost Thou See Them?

Christian, dost thou see them
on the holy ground,
How the powers of darkness
rage thy steps around?
Christian, up and smite them,
counting gain but loss,
In the strength that cometh
by the holy cross.

-----

Christian, dost thou feel them,
how they work within,
Striving, tempting, luring,
goading into sin?
Christian, never tremble;
never be downcast;
Gird thee for the battle,
watch and pray and fast.

-----

Christian, dost thou hear them,
how they speak thee fair?
"Always fast and vigil?
Always watch and prayer?"
Christian, answer boldly:
"While I breathe I pray!"
Peace shall follow battle,
night shall end in day.

-----

Hear the words of Jesus:
"O my servant true;
Thou art very weary,
I was weary, too;
But that toil shall make thee
some day all Mine own,
At the end of sorrow
shall be near my throne."
