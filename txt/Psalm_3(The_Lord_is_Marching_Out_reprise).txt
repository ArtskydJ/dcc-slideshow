# Psalm 3 (The Lord is Marching Out reprise)

For Thou, O LORD, art a shield for me,
my glory and the lifter of my head!
Arise, O LORD Save me,
O my God! Salvation belongs to the LORD. 

-----

His army marches out with dancing,
for he has filled our hearts with joy,
be glad the kingdom is advancing,
the love of God, our battle cry! 

-----

O give thanks to the Lord for His love endures, O give thanks to the Lord for His love endures, O give thanks to the Lord for His love endures forever, forever.
