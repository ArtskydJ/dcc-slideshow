# O God of Mercy, God of Might

O God of mercy, God of might,
in love and pity infinite, 
teach us, as ever in thy sight,
to live our life to thee.

-----

And thou who can'st on earth to die,
that fallen man might live there-by, 
O hear us, for to thee we cry
in hope, O lord, to thee.

-----

Teach us the lesson thou hast taught,
to feel for those thy blood hat brought;
That every word and deed and thought
may work a work for thee.

-----

For they are brethren, far and wide,
since thou, O lord, for them has died;
Then teach us, whatsoe'er betide,
to love them all in thee.

-----

In sickness, sorrow, want, or care,
whate'er it be, tis ours to share,
May we, when help is needed there
give help as unto thee.
