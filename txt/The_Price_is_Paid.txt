# The Price is Paid 

The price is paid,
come let us enter in;
to all that Jesus died to make our own. 
For ev'ry sin
more than enough He gave,
and bought our freedom from each guilty stain. 

-----

The price is paid,
see Satan flee away;
for Jesus crucified destroys his power.
No more to pay,
let accusation cease,
in Christ there is no condemnation now.

-----

The price is paid, alleluia, 
amazing grace, so strong and sure. 
And so with all my heart,
my life in ev'ry part, 
I live to thank You for the price You paid.

-----

The price is paid,
and by that scourging cruel
He took our sicknesses as if His own.
And by His wounds
His body broken there,
His healing touch may now by faith be known.

-----

The price is paid,
'Worthy the Lamb' we cry,
eternity shall never cease His praise.
The Church of Christ
shall rule upon the earth.
In Jesus' name we have authority.

-----

The price is paid, alleluia, 
amazing grace, so strong and sure. 
And so with all my heart,
my life in ev'ry part, 
I live to thank You for the price You paid.
