# Knowing You

All I once held dear,
built my life upon,
all this world reveres
and wars to own. 

-----

All I once thought gain
I have counted loss; 
spent and worthless now
compared to this:

-----

Knowing you, Jesus,
knowing you,
there is no greater thing. 
You're my all, you're the best,
you're my joy, my righteousness,
and I love you, Lord.

-----

Now my heart's desire
is to know you more, 
to be found in you
and known as yours.

-----

To possess by faith
what I could not earn,
all surpassing gift
of righteousness.

-----

Knowing you, Jesus,
knowing you,
there is no greater thing. 
You're my all, you're the best,
you're my joy, my righteousness,
and I love you, Lord.

-----

Oh, to know the pow'r
of your risen life
and to know you in
your sufferings.

-----

To become like you
in your death, my Lord,
so with you to live
and never die.

-----

Knowing you, Jesus,
knowing you,
there is no greater thing.

-----

You're my all, you're the best,
you're my joy, my righteousness, 
you're my all, you're the best,
you're my joy, my righteousness, 
you're my all, you're the best,
you're my joy, my righteousness,

-----

MEN: and I love you, Lord. 
WOMEN: and I love you, Lord. 
MEN: and I love you, Lord. 
WOMEN: and I love you, Lord.
MEN: and I love you, Lord. 
ALL: Love you, Lord.
