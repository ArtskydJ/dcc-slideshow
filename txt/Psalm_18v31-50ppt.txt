# Psalm 18:31-50

All God's promises are sure. Who is God besides the Lord?
He is perfect in His ways. Who the Rock except our God?
It is God who gives me strength, he enables me to stand
High above the battlefield, held up by his powerful hand.

-----

God prepares me well for war, makes my feet as swift as deer,
Arms me with salvation's shield, makes my pathway broad and sure.
I pursued my enemies till they fell beneath my feet,
Beat them fine like blowing dust, low like dirt that lines the street. 

-----

God has rescued me from strife with the nations all around.
He has made me head of all; foreign leaders now bow down.
Yes, the Lord exalted me over all my enemies;
They obey all my commands, cringing low on trembling knees. 

-----

God, the Lord, my Savior, lives! To my Rock be all the praise!
He has overcome my foes, shown me his unfailing grace.
Lord, I will extol your name and make all your blessings known.
You give vict'ry to your king, give his heirs a royal throne.
