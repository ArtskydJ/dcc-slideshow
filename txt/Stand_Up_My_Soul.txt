# Stand Up, My Soul

Stand up, my soul; shake off your fears,
and gird the gospel armor on;
march to the gates of endless joy,
where your great Captain Savior's gone.

-----

Hell and your sins resist your course;
but hell and sin are vanquished foes;
your Jesus nailed them to the cross,
and sang the triumph when He rose.

-----

Then let my soul march boldly on,
pressing forward to the heav'nly gate. 
There peace and joy eternal reign,
and glittering robes for conqu'rors wait.

-----

There shall I wear a starry crown,
and triumph in almighty grace;
while all the armies of the skies join in,
my glorious Leader's praise.
