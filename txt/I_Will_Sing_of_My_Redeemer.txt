# I Will Sing of My Redeemer

I will sing of my Redeemer,
and His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered,
from the curse to set me free.

-----

Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,
with His blood, He purchased me.
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,
paid the debt, and made me free.

-----

I will tell the wondrous story,
how my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
he the ransom freely gave.

-----

Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,
with His blood, He purchased me.
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,
paid the debt, and made me free.

-----

I will praise my dear Redeemer,
his triumphant power I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth
over sin, and death, and hell.

-----

Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,
with His blood, He purchased me.
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,
paid the debt, and made me free.

-----

I will sing of my Redeemer,
and His heav'nly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God with Him to be.

-----

Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,
with His blood, He purchased me.
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,
paid the debt, and made me free.
