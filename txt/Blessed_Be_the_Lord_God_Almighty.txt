# Blessed Be the Lord God Almighty

Father in heaven, how we love You,
we lift Your name in all the earth.
May Your kingdom
be established in our praises, 
as Your people
declare Your mighty works.

Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
who was, and is, and is to come;
blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
who reigns forevermore.
