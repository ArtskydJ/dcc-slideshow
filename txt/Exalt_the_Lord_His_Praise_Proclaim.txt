# Exalt the LORD His Praise Proclaim 

Exalt the LORD his praise proclaim;
all ye his servants, praise his name,
who in the LORD's house ever stand
and humbly serve at his command.

-----

The LORD is good, his praise proclaim;
since it is pleasant, praise his name;
his people for his own he takes
and his peculiar treasure makes.

-----

I know the LORD is high in state,
above all gods our LORD is great;
the LORD performs what he decrees,
in heav'n and earth, in depths and seas. 

-----

He makes the vapors to ascend
in clouds from earth's remotest end;
the lightnings flash at his command;
he holds the tempest in his hand.

-----

Exalt the LORD, his praise proclaim;
all ye his servants, praise his name,
who in the LORD's house ever stand
and humbly serve at his command.

-----

Forever praise and bless his name,
and in the church his praise proclaim;
in Zion is his dwelling place;
praise ye the LORD, show forth his grace,
praise ye the LORD, show forth his grace.
