# Rejoice 

All the earth rejoice,
your Creator reigns
as the only awesome God.
The Alpha and the Omega,
who was, is, and is to come.

-----

Let the oceans roar and the mountains sing,
he provides for all he has made.
So be comforted as he rules with grace.
Rejoice, all the earth, rejoice.

-----

All the world rejoice,
for the baby comes
as a humble prince in the night,
The Word made flesh,
Emmanuel,
the everlasting light.

-----

Let the warmth of heav'n reach the coldest heart
with the gospel of his grace,
For his heel will bruise the serpents' head.
Rejoice, all the world, rejoice.

-----

All the church rejoice,
for your King returns
on a white horse wearing a crown.
He will break the sky
with the angel's shout,
descending from the clouds.

-----

Then the dead will rise from the land and sea,
all his people will ascend.
We will reign with him for eternity.
Rejoice, all the church, rejoice.

-----

Then the dead will rise from the land and sea,
all his people will ascend.
We will reign with him for eternity.
Rejoice, all the church, rejoice.
