# Psalm 119:9-16

Men: How shall a young man cleanse his way?
Women: How shall a young man cleanse his way?
Men: Let him with care Thy word observe.
Women: Let him with care Thy word observe.
Men: With all my heart I have Thee sought;
Women: With all my heart I have Thee sought;
Men: From Thy commands let me not swerve.
Women: let me not swerve.

Men: Thy word I've treasured in my heart.
Women: Thy word I've treasured in my heart.
Men: That I give no offense to Thee.
Women: That I give no offense to Thee.
Men: Praise be to Thee O Lord, my God;
Women: Praise be to Thee O Lord , my God;
Men: Thy statutes teach Thou unto me. Women: Thou unto me.

-----

All: I with my lips have oft declared
the judgments which Thy mouth has shown,
More joy Thy testimonies gave than all
the riches I have known.
I'll on thy precepts meditate,
and have respect to all Thy ways.
I in Thy statutes will delight,
Thy word I will not neglect.

-----

Men: My soul clings to the dust, revive
Women: My soul clings to the dust, revive
Men: And as You promised, let it be,
Women: And as You promised, let it be,
Men: When I recount my ways, You hear;
Women: When I recount my ways, You hear;
Men: Your ordinances teach to me.
Women: LORD, teach to me.

-----

Men: I'll ponder all Your wondrous works;
Women: I'll ponder all Your wondrous works;
Men: And Your commands O help me see.
Women: And Your commands O help me see.
Men: My soul is shedding tears of grief;
Women: My soul is shedding tears of grief;
Men: As You have promised, strengthen me. Women: LORD, strengthen me.

-----

All: A life of falsehood take from me;
Your law now give me in Your grace.
I chose the life of faithfulness;
Before me I Your judgments place.
LORD, let me not be put to shame;
Your testimonies I hold fast.
I'll run the way of Your commands,
For You shall enlarge my heart.
