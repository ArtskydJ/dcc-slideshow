# Dear Lord, Today, Our Child

Dear Lord, today, our child,
An heritage from thee,
We bring in faith and claim for her
Thy promise free.

-----

Dear Lord, today, our child,
Sweet token of thy love,
We bring into thy church
For blessings from above

-----

Dear Lord, today our child,
Rich treasure of thy grace,
We bring upon her brow
The sign and seal to place.

-----

Dear Lord, today, our child,
A gracious gift of thine,
We bring to set apart,
Baptized in Name Divine.
