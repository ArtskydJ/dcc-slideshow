# O Thou Who Camest From Above

O thou who camest from above
the pure celestial fire impart.
Kindle a flame of sacred love
on the mean altar of my heart.

-----

There let it for thy glory burn
with inextinguishable blaze
and trembling to its source return
in humble prayer and fervent praise,
In humble prayer and fervent praise.

-----

Jesus confirm my heart's desire
to work and speak and think for thee.
Still let me guard the holy fire
and stir up thy gift in me.
