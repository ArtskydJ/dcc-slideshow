# O For a Closer Walk with God

O for a closer walk with God,
a calm and heav'nly frame, a light to shine upon the road
that leads me to the Lamb!

-----

Return, O holy Dove,
return, sweet messenger of rest;
I hate the sins that made thee mourn,
and drove thee from my breast.
Return

-----

The dearest idol I have known,
what-e'er that idol be,
help me to tear it from thy throne,
and worship only Thee.
Return

-----

So shall my walk be close with God,
calm and serene my frame;
so purer light shall mark the road
that leads me to the Lamb.
