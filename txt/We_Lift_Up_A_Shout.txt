# We Lift Up A Shout

We march to the tune of a love song,
singing the King's jubilee; 
anointed to enter the hell gate,
anointed to set captives free.

-----

We lift up our banner of worship
and Jesus, our Champion we praise; 
an army of worshipers stands by his side, baptized in his fire
revealing his glorious light.

-----

We lift up a shout,
a victory shout, 
for we've overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our mouth; 

-----

We've declared war
in the name of the Lord, 
We've laid down our lives
that the triumph of Christ
may resound in the earth.

-----

We sing the high praises of heaven
and fight with the sword of the Word; 
to bind ev'ry stronghold of Satan,
preparing the way of the Lord.

> fast transition to next slide

-----

We lift up a standard of worship
that shatters the darkness with light, 
and God will arise on the wings of our praise and march as a Warrior
Who's mighty and able to save.

-----

We lift up a shout,
a victory shout, 
for we've overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our mouth; 

-----

We've declared war
in the name of the Lord, 
we've laid down our lives
that the triumph of Christ
may resound in the earth.
