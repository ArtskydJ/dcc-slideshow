# The Victor

Swallowed into earth's dark womb
death has triumphed, that's what they say.
But try to hold him in the tomb
the Son of Life rose on the third day.

-----

Just look the gates of hell are falling,
crumbling from the inside out.
He's bursting through the walls with laughter
listen to the angels shoutâ€¦

-----

"It is finished
he has done it.
Life conquered death.
Jesus Christ
has won it."

-----

His plan of battle fooled them all.
They led him off to prison to die,
but as he entered hades hall
he broke those hellish chains with a cry.

-----

Just listen to those demons screaming.
See him bruise the serpent's head.
The prisoners of hell he's redeeming,
all the pow'r of death is dead.

-----

It is finished
he has done it.
Life conquered death.
Jesus Christ
has won it.
