# All You That Fear Jehovah's Name 

All you that fear Jehovah's name,
His glory tell, His praise proclaim; 
you children of His chosen race,
stand… in awe before His face, 
stand… in awe before His face.

-----

The suff'ring one He has not spurned,
who unto Him for help has turned; 
from him He has not hid His face,
but answered his request in grace, 
but answered his request in grace.

-----

O Lord, Your goodness makes me raise
amid Your people songs of praise; 
before all them that fear You, now
I worship You and pay my vow; 
I worship You and pay my vow.

-----

For all the meek you will provide;
they shall be fed and satisfied; 
all they that seek the Lord shall live
and never ending praises give, 
and never ending praises give.

-----

The Lord's unfailing righteousness
all generations shall confess; 
from age to age shall men be taught
what wondrous works the Lord has wrought,
what wondrous works the Lord has wrought.
