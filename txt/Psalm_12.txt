# Psalm 12

Help, LORD, because
the godly man now ceases; 
The faithful vanish
from the sons of men. 
They empty falsehood
speak to one another; 
With flat'ring lips
and double heart they speak.

-----

O may the LORD
cut off all lips that flatter, 
And every boasting
tongue that speaks great things 
those who have said,
"With our tongue we will conquer; 
Our lips are ours;
what Lord rules over us?"

-----

In My concern,
because the poor are plundered, 
For the afflicted
groaning in despair 
"Now," says the LORD,
"I will arise to save him, 
I'll place him in
the safety he desires." 

-----

The words proceeding
from the Lord are flawless,
words pure as silver
tested in the fire;
like silver that
is molten in a furnace,
it then emerges
seven times as pure.

-----

O Lord, You will
preserve Your people always,
and from this generation
keep them safe.
On every side
the wicked strut and swagger,
when people glorify
the vilest things.
