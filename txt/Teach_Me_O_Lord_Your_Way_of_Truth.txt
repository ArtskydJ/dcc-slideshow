# Teach Me, O Lord, Your Way of Truth

Teach me, O Lord, Your way of truth,
and from it I will not depart; 
that I may steadfastly obey,
give me an understanding heart.

-----

In Your commandments make me walk,
for in Your law my joy shall be; 
give me a heart that loves Your will,
from discontent and envy free.

-----

Turn now my eyes form vanity,
and cause me in Your ways to tread; 
O let Your servant prove Your word and thus to godly fear be led.

-----

Turn away my reproach and fear;
Your righteous judgments I confess; 
to know Your precepts I desire;
revive me in Your righteousness. 

> From Psalm 119:33-40 The Psalter, 1912; alt. 1990, mod. BISHOP L.M. Joseph P. Holbrook, 1874
