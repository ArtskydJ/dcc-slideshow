# O Thou That Hear'st When Sinners Cry

O Thou that hear'st when sinners cry,
behold them not with angry look,
but blot their mem'ry from Thy book.

-----

Create my nature pure within,
and form my soul averse to sin:
let Thy good Spirit ne'er depart,
nor hide Thy presence from my heart.

-----

I cannot live without Thy light,
cast out and banished from Thy sight:
thy holy joys, my God, restore,
and guard me that I fall no more.

-----

A broken heart, my God, my King,
is all the sacrifice I bring;
the God of grace will ne'er despise
a broken heart for sacrifice.

-----

My soul lies humbled in the dust,
and owns Thy dreadful sentence just;
look down, O Lord, with pitying eye,
and save the soul condemned to die.

-----

Then will I teach the world Thy ways;
sinners shall learn Thy sovereign grace;
I'll lead them to my Savior's blood,
and they shall praise a pard'ning God.
