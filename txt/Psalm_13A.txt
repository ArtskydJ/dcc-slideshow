# Psalm 13

How long will you forget me, Lord? 
Forever will it be?
How long until you show your face 
which you've concealed from me?
How long must I advise my soul, 
and constant sadness know? 
How long must I be subject 
to the triumph of my foe?

-----

Consider me, O Lord, my God; 
give answer to my cry. 
Let me see light, or I will 
sleep in death with those who die.
"See, I have overcome him now!" 
My enemy will call; 
my adversaries will rejoice 
when I begin to fall.

> But your unfailing love I trust; . your saving pow'r I praise. The Lord in bounty dealt with me; . my songs to him I raise.
