# Wonderful Merciful Savior 

Wonderful, merciful Savior,
precious Redeemer and Friend,
who would have thought that a Lamb could rescue the souls of men?
Oh, you rescue the souls of men.

-----

You are the One that we praise,
you are the One we adore,
you give the healing and grace our
hearts always hunger for.
Oh, our hearts always hunger for.

-----

Counselor, Comforter, Keeper,
Spirit we long to embrace;
you offer hope when our hearts have hopelessly lost the way.
Oh, we've hopelessly lost the way.

-----

You are the One that we praise,
you are the One we adore,
you give the healing and grace our
hearts always hunger for.
Oh, our hearts always hunger for.

-----

Almighty, infinite Father,
faithfully loving your own;
here in our weakness you find us
falling before your throne.
Oh, we're falling before your throne.

-----

You are the One that we praise,
you are the One we adore,
you give the healing and grace our
hearts always hunger for.
Oh, our hearts always hunger for.

-----

You are the One that we praise,
you are the One we adore,
you give the healing and grace our
hearts always hunger for.
Oh, our hearts always hunger for.
