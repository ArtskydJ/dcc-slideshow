# Great High Priest

Let us draw near with confidence,
we have a Great High Priest.
There's mercy enough for all our sins,
we have a Great High Priest.

-----

He was made weak and He was tried,
we have a Great High Priest.
He's able to feel and sympathize,
we have a Great High Priest.

-----

He's the Lamb of God,
slain before the ages; 
the only Son,
the Servant crowned as King.
The One who came
to crush the works of darkness, 
And He will fill all things, all things.

-----

Let us each come with conscience cleansed, we have a Great High Priest.
It's by His shed blood we enter in,
we have a Great High Priest.

-----

We trust in no merits of our own,
we have a Great High Priest.
But look to the power of the cross alone,
we have a Great High Priest.
We have a Great High Priest.
