# Psalm 32

What Blessedness belongs to him Who has forgiven been. 
For whom transgressions have been cleared, And covered is his sin. 
Blessed is the one for whom the LORD Counts no iniquity,
And in whose spirit is no taint of insincerity.

-----

I languished, silent in my guilt; My days were filled with groans.
On me Your hand pressed day and night, And heat dried up my bones. 
My sin I then confessed to You, Not hiding guiltiness; 
I said, "I will before the LORD Transgressions now confess."

-----

Then You released me from my sin, And took its guilt away. 
And therefore while You may be found, Let all the godly pray. 
They'll not be harmed by rising floods. In You I hide in peace; 
You keep me safe, surrounding me With songs of my release.

-----

Instruction I will give to you, And teach the way to go. 
My watchful eye will guide your steps; My counsel you will know. 
Be not like senseless horse or mule, Which if you would subdue. 
You must with bit and bridle hold to bring him close to you.

-----

How many griefs the wicked earns as part of his reward; 
But cov'nant love surround the one whose trust is in the LORD. 
Be glad and shout, you righteous ones, And in the LORD rejoice; 
And let all those with upright hearts sing out with joyful voice.

> A Psalm of David. A Contemplation.
