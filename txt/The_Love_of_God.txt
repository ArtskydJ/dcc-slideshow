# The Love of God 

The love of God is greater far
than tongue or pen can ever tell;
it goes beyond the highest star;
and reaches to the lowest hell;

-----

The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave his Son to win;
his erring child he reconciled,
and pardoned from his sin. 

-----

O Love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure
the saints' and angels' song.

-----

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
and were the skies of parchment made,
were every stalk on earth a quill,
and every man a scribe by trade,

-----

to write the love of God above,
would drain the ocean dry.
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
though stretched from sky to sky.

-----

O Love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure
the saints' and angels' song.

-----

He is alive, and he is Lord,
now crowned with heaven's highest name;
and there in him, by love restored
with all creation we'll proclaim:

-----

"Worthy the Lamb, the great I Am,
of glory, pow'r and might!"
With joy we'll trace his boundless grace
in all it's depth and height.

-----

O Love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure
the saints' and angels' song.

-----

O Love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure
the saints' and angels' song.
