# Raise Up an Army 

Raise up an army, O God,
awake Your people throughout the earth;
raise up an army, O God,
to proclaim Your kingdom,
to declare Your word,
to reveal Your glory, O God.

-----

Our hope, our heart, our vision:
to see in ev'ry land,
Your chosen people coming forth;
fulfilling Your holy mission,
united as we stand,
pledging our lives unto You, Lord. 

-----

Raise up an army, O God,
awake Your people throughout the earth;
raise up an army, O God,
to proclaim Your kingdom,
to declare Your word,
to reveal Your glory, O God.

-----

O God, our glorious Maker,
we marvel at Your grace,
that You would use us in Your plan;
rejoicing at Your favor,
delighting in Your ways,
we'll gladly follow Your commands. 

-----

Raise up an army, O God,
awake Your people throughout the earth;
raise up an army, O God,
to proclaim Your kingdom,
to declare Your word,
to reveal Your glory, O God.
