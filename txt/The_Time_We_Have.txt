# The Time We Have Is Precious

The time we have is precious
we have no time to waste
in looking over shoulders
to see who'll take our place.
We need to have a vision
and not a sense of lack;
you never make decisions
if you keep on looking back.

-----

God looks for a people
the faithful and the strong
to speak to situations
and cause things to be born;
captives of a vision,
singers of a song,
who only live to see his kingdom come,
who only live to see his kingdom come.

-----

The fields are white to harvest,
the laborers are few,
and word comes to the leaders;
what now will you do?
Will you sit in introspection
until the coming day,
or will you rise like young men,
and will you lead the way? 

-----

God looks for a people
the faithful and the strong
to speak to situations
and cause things to be born;
captives of a vision,
singers of a song,
who only live to see his kingdom come,
who only live to see his kingdom come.

-----

We can't boast of tomorrow;
we only have today.
The past lies dead behind us,
forgotten along the way.
Let faith rise up among us,
to see his kingdom come,
and let us run the race with joy;
let's see his will be done. 

-----

God looks for a people
the faithful and the strong
to speak to situations
and cause things to be born;
captives of a vision,
singers of a song,
who only live to see his kingdom come,
who only live to see his kingdom come.

-----

Will we be that people,
or will he pass us by?
Is there no one among us
who'll even dare to try?
Or will his zeal consume us,
and will our lives be run
seeing kingdoms overthrown
in the name of God's own Son? 

-----

God looks for a people
the faithful and the strong
to speak to situations
and cause things to be born;
captives of a vision,
singers of a song,
who only live to see his kingdom come,
who only live to see his kingdom come.
