# O Come, O Come, Immanuel

O come, O come, Immanuel, 
and ransom captive Israel,
that mourns in lonely exile here,
until the Son of God appear.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Immanuel
has come to thee, O Israel.

-----

O come, O come, thou Lord of might,
who to thy tribes, on Sinai's height,
in ancient times didst give the law
in cloud and majesty and awe.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Immanuel
has come to thee, O Israel.

-----

O come, thou Rod of Jesse, free
thine own from Satan's tyranny;
from depths of hell thy people save,
and give them vict'ry o'er the grave.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Immanuel
has come to thee, O Israel.

-----

O come, thou Dayspring from on high
and cheer us by thy drawing nigh;
disperse the gloomy clouds of night,
and death's dark shadows put to flight.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Immanuel
has come to thee, O Israel.

-----

O come, thou Key of David, come
and open wide our heav'nly home;
make safe the way that leads on high,
and close the path to misery.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Immanuel
has come to thee, O Israel.
