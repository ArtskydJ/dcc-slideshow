# Psalm 51

God, be merciful to me;
on thy grace I rest my plea; 
plenteous in compassion thou,
blot out my transgressions now; 
wash me, make me pure within;
cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin. 

-----

My transgressions I confess;
grief and guilt my soul oppress. 
I have sinned against thy grace,
and provoked thee to thy face. 
I confess thy judgment just;
speechless, I thy mercy trust. 

-----

I am evil, born in sin;
thou desirest truth within. 
Thou alone my Savior are,
teach thy wisdom to my heart. 
Make me pure, thy grace bestow,
wash me whiter than the snow.

-----

Broken, humbled to the dust
by thy wrath and judgment just, 
let my contrite heart rejoice,
and in gladness hear thy voice; 
from my sins, O hide thy face,
blot them out in boundless grace.

-----

Gracious God, my heart renew,
make my spirit right and true. 
Cast me not away from thee,
let thy Spirit dwell in me; 
thy salvation's joy impart,
steadfast make my willing heart.

-----

Sinners then shall learn from me,
and return, O God, to thee. 
Savior all my guilt remove,
and my tongue shall sing thy love. 
Touch my silent lips, O Lord,
and my mouth shall praise accord.
