# Stand Up O God

Stand up, O God, be present now,
and all who hate you, let them run
like driven smoke, like melting wax,
bound for destruction, doomed to die.

-----

But let the righteous sing and dance,
yes, sing and dance and shout for joy,
for he who rides upon the clouds
is coming, as he came of old. 

-----

His justice vindicates the oppressed,
he frees the pris'ner, brings him home. 
Stand up, O God, be present now,
and we will sing and shout for joy.

-----

Stand up, O God, be present now,
as once on Sinai you were heard
by those who left the prison's chain,
who crossed the sea and faced the sand.

-----

They ate the manna, drank from springs provided by your gracious love. 
They watched as mighty armies fled,
and so they gained the promised land.

-----

Now, marching on to Zion's mount,
we see the heav'nly hosts descend. 
Stand up, O God, be present now,
and we will sing and shout for joy.

-----

Stand up, O God, be present now,
and we, your people, will rejoice,
for you have saved us from the pit,
for you have brought us back from death.

-----

So, to your holy place, we come
with choirs and music, young and old.
Rebuke the godless, cast them down
till humbled, they for mercy call;

-----

Then men shall listen for your voice
as riding through the heav'ns you come. 
Stand up, O God, be present now,
and we will sing and shout for joy.
