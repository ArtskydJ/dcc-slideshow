# Psalm 63.1-5

O God, You are my God;
Early will I seek You;
My soul thirsts for You;
My flesh longs for You
 In a dry and thirsty land 

-----

Where there is no water. 
So I have looked for You
in the sanctuary,
 To see Your power and Your glory. 

-----

Because Your loving kindness
is better than life,
My lips shall praise You.
Thus I will bless You while I live;

-----

I will lift up my hands in Your name.
My soul shall be satisfied
as with marrow and fatness,
And my mouth shall praise You with joyful lips.
