# O Worship the King

O worship the King, all glorious above,
And gratefully sing His wonderful love; 
Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise. 

-----

O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,
Whose robe is the light,
whose canopy space! 
His chariots of wrath
the deep thunderclouds form, 
And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.
