# Psalm 44A

O God, we have heard of Your works with our ears;
Our fathers have told what You did in past years:
How nations were crushed and cast out by Your hand;
You planted our fathers to live in the land.

-----

Success did not come from the sword in their hand,
Nor by their arm's strength did they conquer the land.
But rather it was by the light of Your face,
Your right hand and arm, 
for You showed them Your grace.

-----

O God, You alone are forever my King;
Command, and for Jacob deliverance bring.
Through You we will surely push back all our foes,
Through Your name we'll trample on those 
who oppose.

-----

# No trust will I place in my sword or my bow;
We'll boast in the God who saved us from the foe;
All those hating us You have brought down in shame,
And so we will ever give thanks to Your name.

No trust will I place in my sword or my bow;
We'll boast in the God who saved us from the foe;
All those hating us You have brought down in shame,
And so we will ever give thanks to Your name.
