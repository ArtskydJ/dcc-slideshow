# I Will Enter His Gates (Psalm 100)

I will enter His gates
with thanksgiving in my heart;
I will enter his courts with praise. 
I will say this is the day
that the Lord has made;
I will rejoice and bless His glorious Name.

-----

For the Lord is good,
ever merciful,
I will rejoice and bless His glorious Name. 
For the Lord is good,
ever merciful,
His truth endures to generations all. 

-----

O enter His gates
all you peoples with a shout;
O enter His courts with song. 
O serve the Lord with gladness
and bless His Name;
He is our God and we are not our own. 

-----

Know ye that the Lord,
He created all,
and brings His people into pastures green. 
For the Lord is good,
ever merciful,
His truth endures to generations all. 

-----

For the Lord is good,
ever merciful,
I will rejoice and lift my thanks to Him.
He has made me glad,
He has made me glad,
I will rejoice and give my thanks to Him.
