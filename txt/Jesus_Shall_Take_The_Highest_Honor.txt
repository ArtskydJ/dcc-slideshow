# Jesus Shall Take The Highest Honor 

Jesus shall take the highest honor,
Jesus shall take the highest praise; 
Let all earth join heav'n in exalting
the Name which is above all other names.

# Jesus Shall Take The Highest Honor

Let's bow the knee in humble adoration,
For at His name ev'ry knee must bow. 
Let every tongue confess
He is Christ, God's only Son,
Sovereign Lord we give You glory now. 

-----

For all honor and blessing and power
Belongs to You, belongs to You. 
All honor and blessing and power
Belongs to You, belongs to You,
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God.
