# Glorious Things of Thee are Spoken

Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God;
he whose word cannot be broken
formed thee for his own abode:

-----

On the Rock of Ages founded,
what can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation's walls surrounded,
thou may'st smile at all thy foes.

-----

See the streams of living waters,
springing from eternal love,
well supply thy sons and daughters,
and all fear of want remove;

-----

Who can faint, while such a river
ever flows their thirst t'assuage?
Grace which, like the Lord, the giver,
never fails from age to age.

-----

Round each habitation hov'ring,
see the cloud and fire appear
for a glory and a cov'ring,
showing that the Lord is near:

-----

Thus deriving from their banner
light by night and shade by day,
safe they feed upon the manna
which he gives them when they pray.

-----

Saviour, if of Zion's city,
I through grace, a member am,
let the world deride or pity, 
I will glory in thy Name:

-----

fading is the worldling's pleasure,
all his boasted pomp and show;
solid joys and lasting treasure
none but Zion's children know.
