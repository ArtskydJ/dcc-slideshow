# Awake, O Israel

Awake, O Israel,
put off thy slumber
and the truth shall set you free; 
for out of Zion
comes thy Deliverer,
in the year of jubilee.

O, hallelujah,
O, hallelujah, hallelujah, praise the LORD! 
O, hallelujah,
O, hallelujah, hallelujah, praise the LORD! 

-----

For in the furnace
of much affliction
I have chosen thee, behold;
and so for iron
I'll give thee silver
and for brass I'll give thee gold. 

-----

O, hallelujah,
O, hallelujah, hallelujah, praise the LORD! 
O, hallelujah,
O, hallelujah, hallelujah, praise the LORD! 

-----

Thou art My chosen,
for I have sought thee;
thou art graven on My hands; 
and I will gather
all those that gather,
they shall come back to their land. 

-----

O, hallelujah,
O, hallelujah, hallelujah, praise the LORD! 
O, hallelujah,
O, hallelujah, hallelujah, praise the LORD! 
Hallelujah, praise the LORD!
Hallelujah, praise the LORD.
