# Hail to the Lord's Anointed

Hail to the Lord's anointed,
great David's greater Son!
Hail in the time appointed,
His reign on earth begun!
He comes to break oppression,
to set the captive free;
To take away transgression
and rule in equity.

-----

He comes with comfort speedy
to those who suffer wrong;
To help the poor and needy,
and bid the weak be strong;
To give them songs for sighing,
their darkness turn to light,
Whose souls, condemned and dying,
were precious in His sight.

-----

He shall come down like showers
upon the fruitful earth;
And love, joy, and hope, like flowers,
spring in His path to birth.
Before Him, on the mountains,
shall peace, the herald, go,
And righteousness, in fountains,
from hill to valley flow.

-----

O'er every foe victorious,
He on His throne shall rest;
From age to age more glorious,
all blessing and all blest.
The tide of time shall never
His covenant remove;
His Name shall stand forever,
His Name to us is Love.
