# O Worship the King/Psalm 104.31-35

O worship the King, all glorious above,
and gratefully sing His wonderful love. 
Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise. 

-----

O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,
whose robe is the light, whose canopy space. 
His chariots of wrath the deep thunder-clouds form,
and dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

-----

Forever O may the LORD's glory stand!
The LORD shall enjoy each work of His hand. 
He looks on the earth and it trembles in fear;
when He touches mountains,
the smoke will appear.

-----

I'll sing to the LORD as long as I live,
sing praise to my God while life He will give. 
My thoughts about Him will sweet pleasure afford.
For I am rejoicing each day in the LORD.

-----

Consumed from the earth let sinners then be;
The wicked in life no more let us see. 
And now, O my soul, blessing give to the Lord.
Let glad hallelujahs ring; O praise the LORD!
