# Psalm 148 (Hallelujah, Praise Jehovah)

Hallelujah, praise Jehovah,
from the heavens praise his name;
praise Jehovah in the highest,
all his angels, praise proclaim.

-----

All his hosts together praise him,
sun and moon and stars on high:
praise him, O you heav'ns of heavens,
and you floods above the sky. 

-----

Let them praises give Jehovah,
they were made at his command;
them forever he established,
his decree shall ever stand. 

-----

From the earth, O praise Jehovah,
all you seas, you monsters all;
fire and hail and snow and vapors,
stormy winds that hear his call.

-----

All you fruitful trees and cedars,
all you hills and mountains high,
creeping things and beasts and cattle,
birds that in the heavens fly; 

-----

Kings of earth, and all you people,
princes great, earth's judges all;
praise his name, young men and maidens, aged men, and children small. 

-----

Let them praises give Jehovah,
for his name, alone is high,
and his glory is exalted
far above the earth and sky.
