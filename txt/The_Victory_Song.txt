# The Victory Song

With your people I will praise you,
hallelujah. 
For alone you are holy,
enthroned on the praises of Israel. 
We will praise your name forever,
hallelujah. 
May Your name be exalted here on earth
and in heaven above.

-----

You who fear the Lord now praise him, hallelujah. 
All the fam'lies of Gentiles shall turn to
and worship before you, Lord. 
We who seek the Lord will praise him, hallelujah. 
May our hearts live forever
satisfied in our loving God.

-----

Lord our fathers cried out to you,
hallelujah. 
For they trusted in you and were not put to shame you delivered them. 
Your posterity will serve you,
hallelujah. 
They will come and declare
your righteous deeds to those not yet born.

-----

For the kingdom is the Lord's own,
hallelujah. 
Lord, you rule all the nations in judgment and justice you govern them. 
Yes! God's kingdom is increasing,
hallelujah. 
Lord you cause righteousness and praise to spring forth throughout the earth.

-----

Jesus Lamb of God our Savior,
we will praise your name! 
Out of every nation you purchased your people with your own blood. 
We now reign with you forever,
hallelujah,
for all blessing and honor,
glory and power belong to you.
