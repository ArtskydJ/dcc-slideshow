# Now Thank We All Our God

Now thank we all our God
with heart and hands and voices Who
wondrous things hath done
in whom His world rejoices who from our
mothers arms
hath blessed us on our way with countless
gifts of love and still is ours today.

-----

O may this bounteous God through all our life
be near us with ever joyful hearts and
blessed peace to cheer us and keep us in His grace
and guide us when perplexed and free us from all ills in this world and the next

-----

All praise and thanks to God The Father now be given The Son and Him who reigns with
them in highest heaven the one eternal God whom earth and heav'n adore for thus it was
is now and shall be evermore.
