# Rock of Ages

Rock of ages, cleft for me,
let me hide myself in thee; 
let the water and the blood,
from thy riven side which flowed, 
be of sin the double cure,
cleanse me from its guilt and pow'r. 

-----

Not the labors of my hands
can fulfill thy Law's demands; 
could my zeal no respite know,
could my tears forever flow, 
all for sin could not atone;
thou must save, and thou alone.

-----

Nothing in my hand I bring,
simply to thy cross I cling; 
naked, come to thee for dress;
helpless, look to thee for grace; 
foul, I to the Fountain fly;
wash me, Savior, or I die. 

-----

While I draw this fleeting breath,
when mine eye lids close in death,
when I soar to worlds unknown,
see thee on thy judgment throne.
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
let me hide myself in thee.
