# All That I am I Owe to Thee

All that I am I owe to Thee;
Thy wisdom Lord, has fashioned me. 
I give my make thankful praise,
whose wondrous works my soul amaze.

-----

Ere into being I was brought,
Thine eye did see and in Thy thought
My life in all its perfect plan
was ordered ere my days began.

-----

Thy thoughts, O God, how manifold,
more precious unto me than gold!
I muse on their infinity,
awaking I am still with Thee.

-----

The wicked Thou wilt surely slay;
from me let sinners turn away.
They speak against the name divine;
I count God's enemies as mine.

-----

Search me, O God, my heart discern;
try me my inmost thought to learn;
And lead me if in sin I stray,
to choose the everlasting way.

> HIS WISDOM. Henry K. Oliver, 1832
