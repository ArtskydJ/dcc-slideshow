# Gracious Spirit, Dwell with Me 

Gracious Spirit, dwell with me!
I myself would gracious be; 
And with words that help and heal
Would Thy life in mine reveal; 
And with actions bold and meek
Would for Christ my Savior speak.

-----

Truthful Spirit, dwell with me!
I myself would truthful be; 
And with wisdom kind and clear
Let Thy life in mine appear; 
And with actions brotherly
Speak my Lord's sincerity.

-----

Mighty Spirit, dwell with me!
I myself would mighty be; 
Mighty so as to prevail,
Where unaided man must fail; 
Ever, by a mighty hope,
Pressing on and bearing up. 

-----

Holy Spirit, dwell with me!
I myself would holy be; 
Separate from sin, I would
Choose and cherish all things good, 
And whatever I can be
Give to Him 
Who gave me Thee!
