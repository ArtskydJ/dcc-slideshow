# There is a Redeemer

There is a Redeemer,
Jesus, God's own Son.
Precious Lamb of God,
Messiah, Holy One.

Thank You, O my Father,
for giving us your Son,
and leaving your Spirit till
the work on earth is done.

Jesus my Redeemer,
Name above all names.
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
 O for sinners slain. 

-----

Thank You, O my Father,
for giving us your Son,
and leaving your Spirit till
the work on earth is done.

-----

When I stand in glory,
I will see his face,
and there I'll serve my King forever
in that holy place.

Thank You, O my Father,
for giving us your Son,
and leaving your Spirit till
the work on earth is done.
