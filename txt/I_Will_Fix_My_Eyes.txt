# I Will Fix My Eyes

I will fix my eyes on you, my Lord,
for you have run this race;
and I will worship you,
the Author and Perfecter of my faith.

-----

For the joy you saw
you endured the cross;
persevering to the end
through darkness and pain,
and by your grace I will do the same.

-----

I will fix my eyes on you, my Lord,
for you have run this race;
and I will worship you,
the Author and Perfecter of my faith.

-----

Lord, you care for me,
you're my great High Priest;
made like us in ev'ry way,
and yet without sin,
tempted much but never giving in.

-----

I will fix my eyes on you, my Lord,
for you have run this race;
and I will worship you,
the Author and Perfecter of my faith.

-----

I will fix my eyes on you, my Lord,
for you have run this race;
and I will worship you,
the Author and Perfecter of my faith.
