# Psalm 14 (Lord Protect Your People)

Lord, protect your people.
Save our foolish hearts.
Look down from Heaven;
We will not depart!

-----

Through Christ, the Lord's salvation,
From Zion's hill has come;
And heals His chosen nation;
And leads the outcasts home.

-----

Don't the wicked understand
they must call on the Lord?
God is with the righteous;
Refuge of the poor!

-----

Through Christ, the Lord's salvation,
From Zion's hill has come;
And heals His chosen nation;
And leads the outcasts home.

-----

Everyone has turned aside
All have gone astray.
None of us is good, not one.
Seek us, Lord, all our days!

-----

Through Christ, the Lord's salvation,
From Zion's hill has come;
And heals His chosen nation;
And leads the outcasts home.
