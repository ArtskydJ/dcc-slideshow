My God, O King,
in praise I will exalt you; 
and I will bless
your name forevermore. 
Yes, everyday
time and again I'll bless you
and praise your name
both now and evermore.

Great is the LORD, 
how worthy to be praised! 
His greatness is
unsearchable. 
Your works each race
to coming race will praise 
and tell of all
your mighty acts.

-----

The LORD is good
to all of his creation, 
compassion has
on all that he has made. 
All you have made,
O LORD, with thanks will praise you; 
your chosen holy
ones will you extol.

-----

The glory of
your kingdom they will tell, 
the greatness of
your power proclaim, 
that sons of men
may know your mighty acts, 
your kingdom's splendor
glorious.

-----

Your kingdom is
an everlasting kingdom; 
your rule endures
through generations all. 
The Lord upholds
all those who down are falling 
and raises up
all those who are bowed down.
