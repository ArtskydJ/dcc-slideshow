# Safe in the Shadow of the Lord

Safe in the shadow of the Lord,
beneath his hand and power,
I trust in him, my fortress and strength
and my dwelling place. 
My hope is set on God alone,
though Satan spreads his snare.
I trust in him to keep me in his care.

-----

More love to thee, O Christ,
more love to thee.
You alone I seek,
draw my heart to you
as I seek your holy face. 
More love to thee, O Christ,
more love to thee.

-----

From fears and phantoms of the night,
from foes about my way,
I trust in him, by darkness and day,
unafraid I stand.
His holy angels keep my feet
secure from every stone;
I trust in him and unafraid go on.

-----

More love to thee, O Christ,
more love to thee.
You alone I seek,
draw my heart to you
as I seek your holy face. 
More love to thee, O Christ,
more love to thee.

-----

Strong in the everlasting name,
your saints have dwelt secure,
sufficient is your arm alone,
our defense is sure.
Our God, our help in ages past
and our hope for years to come;
everlasting God and endless years the same.
