# A Mighty Fortress Is Our God 

A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing; 
our helper He amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing.

-----

For still our ancient foe
doth seek to work us woe; 
his craft and power are great;
and armed with cruel hate, 
on earth is not his equal.

-----

Did we in our own strength confide,
our striving would be losing; 
were not the right man on our side,
the man of God's own choosing.

-----

Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He, 
Lord Sabaoth His name,
from age to age the same, 
and He must win the battle. 

-----

And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us,
we will not fear, for God hath willed
his truth to triumph through us.

-----

The prince of darkness, grim,
we tremble not for him; 
his rage we can endure,
for lo! his doom is sure; 
one little word shall fell him.

-----

That Word above all earthly pow'rs,
no thanks to them, abideth;
the Spirit and the gifts are ours
through him who with us sideth.
 

-----

Let goods and kindred go,
this mortal life also;
the body they may kill;
God's truth abideth still; 
His kingdom is forever.
