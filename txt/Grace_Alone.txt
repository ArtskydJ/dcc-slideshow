# Grace Alone

Ev'ry promise we can make,
ev'ry prayer and step of faith, 
ev'ry diff'rence we will make
is only by his grace.

-----

Ev'ry mountain we will climb,
ev'ry ray of hope we shine, 
ev'ry blessing left behind
is only by his grace.

-----

Grace alone which God supplies,
strength unknown he will provide, 
Christ in us our Cornerstone,
we will go forth in grace alone.

-----

Ev'ry soul we long to reach,
ev'ry heart we hope to teach, 
ev'rywhere we share his peace
is only by his grace.

-----

Ev'ry loving word we say,
ev'ry tear we wipe away, 
ev'ry sorrow turned to praise
is only by his grace.

-----

Grace alone which God supplies,
strength unknown he will provide, 
Christ in us our Cornerstone,
we will go forth in grace alone.

-----

Grace alone which God supplies,
strength unknown he will provide, 
Christ in us our Cornerstone,
we will go forth in grace alone. 
We will go forth in grace alone.
