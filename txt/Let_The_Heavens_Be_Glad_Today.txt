# Let The Heavens Be Glad 

Let the heavens be glad today,
let the people of the earth rejoice.
Sing together in joyful praise
in the hope that we all share.

-----

The Lord is on His way.
He will come to restore all things.
He will judge in righteousness,
shout the message ev'rywhere!

-----

Our Lord reigns,
He reigns in righteousness;
a reign of righteousness
that will never end.

-----

Our Lord comes,
and ev'ry eye shall see 
the Lord of majesty
when He comes again.

-----

Let the nations repent therefore,
let the people of the earth convert,
so that times of refreshing come
from the presence of the Lord.

-----

Thy Kingdom come, O Lord. 
May Thy will be done on earth,
as it is in heaven now.
Shout the message ev'rywhere!

-----

Our Lord reigns,
He reigns in righteousness;
a reign of righteousness
that will never end.

-----

Our Lord comes
and ev'ry eye shall see,
the Lord of majesty,
when He comes again.

-----

Our God reigns,
He reigns in righteousness;
a reign of righteousness
that will never end.
