# In the Tomb so Cold (Christ is Risen) 

In the tomb so cold they laid Him,
death its victim claim'd.
Pow'rs of hell, they could not hold Him;
back to life He came!

-----

Hell had spent its fury on Him,
Left Him crucified. 
Yet, by blood He boldly conquered,
sin and death defied.

-----

MEN - Christ is risen!
WOMEN - Christ has risen!
MEN - Death has been conquered.
WOMEN - Death has been conquered.
MEN - Christ is risen!
WOMEN - Christ is risen!
ALL - He now reigns for ever.

-----

Now the fear of death is broken,
Love has won the crown. 
Pris'ners of the darkness, listen,
walls are tumbling down.

-----

Raised from death to heav'n ascending,
Love's exalted King. 
Let His song of joy, unending,
Thru the nations ring!

-----

MEN - Christ is risen!
WOMEN - Christ has risen!
MEN - Death has been conquered.
WOMEN - Death has been conquered.
MEN - Christ is risen!
WOMEN - Christ is risen!
ALL - He now reigns for ever.
