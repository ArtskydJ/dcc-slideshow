# Fill Your Hearts with Joy

Fill your hearts with joy and gladness,
sing and praise your God and mine!
Great the Lord in love and wisdom,
might and majesty divine!
And to this, we give our lives to see You glorified.
He who framed the starry heavens
knows and names them as they shine.

-----

Praise the Lord, His people, praise Him! Wounded souls His comfort know;
Those who fear Him find His mercies,
peace for pain and joy for woe; 
And to this, we give our lives to see You glorified.
Humble hearts are high exalted,
Human pride and pow'r laid low.

-----

Praise the Lord for times and seasons,
cloud and sunshine, wind and rain;
Spring to melt the snows of winter
till the waters flow again; 
And to this, we give our lives to see You glorified.
Grass upon the mountain pastures,
golden valleys thick with grain.

-----

Fill your hearts with joy and gladness,
peace and plenty crown your days;
Love His laws, declare His judgments,
walk in all His words and ways; 
And to this, we give our lives to see You glorified.
He the Lord and we His children
praise the Lord, all people, praise!
