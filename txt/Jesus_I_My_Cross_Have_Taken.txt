# Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken

Jesus, I my cross have taken,
all to leave and follow Thee;
destitute, despised, forsaken,
Thou from hence my all shall be.
Perish every fond ambition,
all I've sought or hoped or known;
yet how rich is my condition!
God and heaven are still my own.

-----

Let the world despise and leave me,
they have left my Savior, too;
human hearts and looks deceive me;
Thou art not, like man, untrue;
and, while Thou shalt smile upon me,
God of wisdom, love, and might,
foes may hate and friends may shun me;
show Thy face and all is bright.

-----

Man may trouble and distress me,
'twill but drive me to Thy breast.
Life with trials hard may press me;
Heaven will bring me sweeter rest.
oh, 'tis not in grief to harm me
while Thy love is left to me;
oh, 'twere not in joy to charm me,
were that joy unmixed with Thee.

-----

Take, my soul, thy full salvation,
rise o'er sin and fear and care;
joy to find in every station
something still to do or bear;
think what Spirit dwells within thee,
what a Father's smiles is thine,
what a savior died to win thee:
child of heaven, shouldst thou repine?

-----

Hasten on from grace to glory,
armed by faith, and winged by prayer;
heaven's eternal days before thee,
God's own hand shall guide thee there.
Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
swift shall pass thy pilgrim days;
hope shall change to glad fruition,
faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
