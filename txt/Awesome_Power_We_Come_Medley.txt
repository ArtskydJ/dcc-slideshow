# Awesome Power

Awesome power, boundless grace;
None can fathom all Your ways.
Truth and love are found in Your heart alone;
Righteousness surrounds Your throne.
Holy, holy, holy Lord most high;
Holy, holy--, holy Lord most high.

# We Come, O Christ, to You

We come, O Christ, to You,
true Son of God and man,
By whom all things consist,
in whom all life began:
In You alone
we live and move, and have our being
in Your love.

-----

You are the Way to God,
Your blood our ransom paid;
In You we face our Judge and Maker unafraid.
Before the throne
Absolved we stand,
Your love has met Your law's demand.

-----

You are the living Truth! 
All wisdom dwells in You
The Source of every skill,
the One eternal TRUE
O great I AM! 
In You we rest,
sure answer to our every quest.

-----

You only are true Life,
to know You is to live
The more abundant life that earth
can never give:
O risen Lord! 
We live in You: In us each day
Your life renew!

-----

We worship You, Lord Christ,
our Savior and our King,
To You our youth and strength
adoringly we bring:
So fill our hearts,
That all may view Your life in us,
and turn to You.
