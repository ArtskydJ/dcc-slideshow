# Gracious Savior

Gracious Savior, gentle Shepherd,
our little ones are dear to thee;
gathered with thine arms and carried
in thy bosom may they be
sweetly, gently, safely tended,
from all want and danger free.

-----

Tender Shepherd, never leave them
from thy fold to go astray;
by thy look of love directed,
may they walk the narrow way;
thus direct them, and protect them,
lest they fall an easy prey.

-----

Let thy holy Word instruct them:
fill their minds with heav'nly light;
let thy love and grace constrain them,
to approve whate'er is right,
take thine easy yoke and wear it,
and to prove thy burden light.

-----

Cleanse their hearts from sinful folly
in the stream thy love supplied;
mingled streams of blood and water
flowing from thy wounded side;
and to heav'nly pastures lead them,
where thine own still waters glide.
