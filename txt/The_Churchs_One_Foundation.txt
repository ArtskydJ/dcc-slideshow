# The Church's One Foundation 

The church's one foundation
is Jesus Christ her Lord; 
she is His new creation by water and the Word: from heav'n He came and sought her 
to be His holy bride; with His own blood
He bought her and for her life He died. 

-----

Elect from ev'ry nation,
yet one o'er all the earth, 
her charter of salvation:
one Lord, one faith, one birth; 
One holy name she blesses,
partakes one holy food,
and to one hope she presses,
with ev'ry grace endued. 

-----

Though with a scornful wonder
men see her sore oppressed, 
By schisms rent asunder, 
by heresies distressed, 
Yet saints their watch are keeping, 
their cry goes up, "How long?" 
And soon the night of weeping
shall be the morn of song! 

-----

The church shall never perish!
Her dear Lord to defend, 
to guide, sustain, and cherish,
is with her to the end; 
though there be those who hate her,
and false sons in her pale, 
against both foe and traitor
she ever shall prevail. 

-----

'Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war, 
She waits the consummation
Of peace forevermore; 
Till, with the vision glorious,
Her longing eyes are blest, 
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the Church at rest.

-----

Yet she on earth has union
with God the Three in One, 
and mystic, sweet communion
with those whose rest is won; 
O happy ones and holy!
Lord, give us grace that we,
like them, the meek and lowly,
on high may dwell with Thee.
