# Psalm 142 (To You, O Lord I lift my voice)

To you, O Lord I lift my voice; I supplication make.
I pour my thoughts out to the Lord, to Him my trouble take.
For when my soul is overwhelmed, My every way You see.
Upon the path on which I walk their traps were laid for me.

-----

None notices. Look to my right, No one regards me there. 
There's no escape for me to take, And none to show me care.
I cried to You, O LORD , and said, "You are my refuge true;
And in the land of those who live, My portion is with You."

-----

Since I'm brought low in misery, O listen to my cry;
Save me from persecuting foes Who stronger are than I.
So, out of bondage, bring my soul That I Your name may praise; The righteous then will join with me, For You have shown me grace.
