# Make Haste, O God, Deliver Me (Psalm 70)

Make haste, O God, deliver me!
Make haste to help me Lord!
And let all those who seek my life
ashamed, confounded be.
Let them be turned back and confused,
that in my hurt desire.
Let them be turned back for their shame,
who say, "A-ha, A-ha!"

-----

Let all who seek You now rejoice
and glad in You abide.
Let those who Your salvation love
say, "God be magnified"

-----

But I, a poor and needy one,
O God, make haste to me.
You are my help, deliverer;
O Lord, do not delay.

> Music: Hugh Wilson, 1800
