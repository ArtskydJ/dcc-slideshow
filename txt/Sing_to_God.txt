# Sing To God 

Sing to God, sing praise to his name,
extol him who rides on the clouds;
clap your hands and shout with joy
to the God of all creation.

God has made the heavens and the earth,
by his pow'r and by his spoken word;
and you and I were made
in the image of the Father,
to reflect the glory of his Son.

Sing to God, sing praise to his name,
extol him who rides on the clouds;

God so loved the world that he had made,
that he sent his only Son to save;
and all who would believe
would receive his gifts of mercy
and power, to become the sons of God.

Sing to God, sing praise to his name,
extol him who rides on the clouds;
clap your hands and shout with joy
to the God of all creation.

Freely you've received, now freely give,
speak the word that others, too, might live;
O the harvest fields are white
and the Lord our God commands us,
go and tell the news to all the earth.

-----

Sing to God, sing praise to his name,
extol him who rides on the clouds;
clap your hands and shout with joy
to the God of all creation.

-----

Sing to God, sing praise to his name,
extol him who rides on the clouds;
clap your hands and shout with joy
to the God of our salvation,
to the God of ev'ry nation.
