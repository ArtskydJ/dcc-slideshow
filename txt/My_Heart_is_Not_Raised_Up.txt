# My Heart is Not Raised Up (Psalm 131)

My heart is not raised up too high,
my eyes don't search beyond the sky. 
I do not seek what can't be known,
nor fret myself over mysteries.

-----

But I have calmed and soothed my soul,
like a child at rest in its mother's arms; 
like this child sleeping by my side,
my soul, in God, knows peace and calm.

-----

All you who love and trust your God,
in this God shall you put your hope. 
For there you'll find unfailing love,
from this time forth, forevermore.
