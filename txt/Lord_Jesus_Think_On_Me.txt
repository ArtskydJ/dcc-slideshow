# Lord Jesus, Think On Me

Lord Jesus think on me 
And purge away my sin
From earthborn passions set me free
And make me pure within.

-----

Lord Jesus think on me 
With anxious thoughts oppressed 
Let me Your loving servant be 
And taste Your promised rest

-----

Lord Jesus think on me 
Nor let me go astray 
Through darkness and perplexity 
Point out Your chosen way

-----

Lord Jesus think on me 
That when the flood is past
May the eternal brightness see
And share Your joy at last
And share Your joy at last
