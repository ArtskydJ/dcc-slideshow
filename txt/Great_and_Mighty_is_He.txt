# Great and Mighty is He 

Great and mighty is he,
great and mighty is he.
Clothed in glory
arrayed in splendor,
great and mighty is he.

Great and mighty is he,
great and mighty is he.
Clothed in glory
arrayed in splendor,
great and mighty is he.

Let us lift his name up high,
celebrate his grace;
for he has redeemed our lives,
and he reigns on high.

Great and mighty is he,
great and mighty is he.
Clothed in glory arrayed in splendor,
great and mighty is,
great and mighty is,
great and mighty is he!
