# Take My Life and Let it Be 

Take my life, and let it be
consecrated, Lord, to Thee.
Take my moments and my days,
let them flow in ceaseless praise,
let them flow in ceaseless praise.

-----

Take my hands, and let them move
at the impulse of Thy love.
Take my feet, and let them be
swift and beautiful for thee,
swift and beautiful for thee.

-----

Take my voice, and let me sing
always, only, for my King.
Take my lips, and let them be
filled with messages from Thee,
filled with messages from Thee.

-----

Take my silver and my gold,
not a mite would I withhold.
Take my intellect, and use
ev'ry pow'r as Thou shalt choose,
ev'ry pow'r as Thou shalt choose.

-----

Take my will and make it Thine;
it shall be no longer mine.
Take my heart, it is Thine own;
it shall be Thy royal throne,
it shall be Thy royal throne.

-----

Take my love; my Lord, I pour
at Thy feet its treasure store.
Take myself, and I will be
ever, only, all for Thee,
ever, only, all for Thee.
