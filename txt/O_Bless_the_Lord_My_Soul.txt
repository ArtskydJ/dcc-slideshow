# O Bless the Lord, My Soul (Psalm 103:1-5)

Bless the Lord, my soul
His Blessedness proclaim;
Let All that is within me join
to bless his holy name.
O Bless the Lord my soul,
His Mercies bear in mind;
Forget not all the ways in which
he has to you been kind.

-----

He pardons and forgives
all your iniquities;
He from each sickness makes you well
and heals you from disease.
He purchases your life
to raise you from the dead;
a crown of mercy and of love
He places on your head.

-----

With good things, your desires
he fully satisfies;
and therefore, like an eagle, you
With youth renewed, arise.
