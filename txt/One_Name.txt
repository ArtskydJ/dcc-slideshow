# One Name

All the universe proclaims,
your power, majesty, and fame.
From the deepest seas
to the galaxies,
all creation magnifies one name:

-----

Jesus, maker of it all,
you're the Alpha and Omega
and you hear me when I call.
Jesus, holder of the keys,
you're the conqueror of death,
the end of history, Jesus.

-----

Every heart beats with one cry,
"In my very essence who am I?"
I was made for him,
but then God hates sin
so all the righteous cling to just one name:

-----

Jesus, Savior of us all,
you're the Alpha and Omega
and we hear you when you call.
Jesus, holder of the keys,
you're the conqueror of death,
the living King of kings, Jesus.

-----

Mighty are your works,
glorious is your fame,
holy are you Lord,
one name above all names.

-----

Jesus, Savior of us all,
you're the Alpha and Omega
and we hear you when you call.
Jesus, holder of the keys,
you're the conqueror of death,
the living King of kings, Jesus.
