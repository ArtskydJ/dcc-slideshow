# Psalm 33 

The Lord by His word
has created the heavens
and He by His breath
made the stars come to be. 
The depths of the ocean
he heaps up together,
and puts in a storehouse
the waves of the sea. 

-----

So let all the earth
and its people revere Him,
and in the Lord's presence
with awe let them stand.
He spoke, it was done,
and continues to stand fast;
all was accomplished
when He gave command.

-----

The Lord brings to nothing
the plans of the nations;
He frustrates their counsel
and makes their schemes fail. 
But all that the Lord
in His heart has intended,
the plans he has made
will forever prevail

-----

The nation the Lord
has embraced is most blessed
where He is acknowledged
to be God alone, 
this people he claims,
His inherited portion,
the ones He has chosen
and calls as His own.

-----

The Lord looks from Heaven
to see all of mankind,
He looks from his throne
on all dwelling on earth 
the same one who made them,
who all their hearts fashioned
who knows what they do
and considers its worth.

-----

The king is not saved
by the strength of his army
the soldier as well should not
trust his own might. 
The strength of a horse
does not make rescue certain;
a horse is a false hope
for winning the fight.

-----

Behold, the Lord's eye
is upon all who trust him,
who hope in His love
and, in awe, Him revere. 
They trust that from death
He will rescue and save them,
and keep them all living
when famine comes near. 

-----

The Lord we await
is our help and protection,
our heart is glad trusting
in His holy name. 
O Lord, let your covenant
love be upon us,
as we hold to you
and the hope that we claim.
