# Fairest Lord Jesus / Jesus, What a Friend for Sinners / My Jesus, I Love Thee

Beautiful Savior! Lord of all nature, Son of God and Son of Man!
Thee will I cherish, thee will I honor, thou, my soul's glory, joy, and crown.

Beautiful Savior! Lord of the nations! Son of God and Son of Man!
Glory and honor, praise, adoration, now and for evermore be thine.

Hallelujah! what a Savior! Hallelujah! what a Friend!
Saving, helping, keeping, loving, he is with me to the end.

My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine;
for thee all the follies of sin I resign.
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art thou;
if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

Hallelujah! what a Savior! Hallelujah! what a Friend!
Saving, helping, keeping, loving, he is with me to the end.
He is with me to the end.
