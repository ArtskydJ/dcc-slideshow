# Above All Powers

Our Lord eternal, You left Your throne
became a servant, a man without a home:
despised, rejected, forsaken by all men,
suffering the curses for our sin.

-----

By God forsaken, yet God approved;
the perfect Lamb, You, our every sin removed.
For this we praise You and glory in the cross,
Where You paid sin's wage for each of us.

-----

Crucified, laid behind the stone;
You lived to die, rejected and alone;
spotless lamb, sacrificed for sin
For Adam's fall You paid the price once for all.

-----

Above all powers, above all kings,
above all nature and all created things;
above all wisdom and all the ways of man,
All were Yours before the world began.

-----

Above all kingdoms, above all thrones,
above all wonders the world has ever known;
above all wealth and treasures of the earth,
there's no way to measure what You're worth.

-----

Magnified, honored and extolled
we worship You, whom none could dare behold
Filled with awe, reverence, joy and love
We stand before, Your throne and praise You:

-----

Glorified, Lamb upon the throne;
You died, to reign, to conquer and to own
all the earth, sea and sky above;
all kingdoms, thrones, 
and rulers captured by Your love.
With the saints, in earth and sky above;
to You we bow as eager captives of Your love.
