# How Can It Be?

O Saviour, as my eyes behold
The wonders of Thy might untold,
The heav'ns in glorious light arrayed,
The vast creation Thou hast made—
And yet to think Thou lovest me—
My heart cries out, "How can it be?"

-----

How can it be? How can it be?
That God should love a soul like me,
O how can it be?

-----

As at the cross I humbly bow
And gaze upon Thy thorn-crowned brow,
And view the precious bleeding form
By cruel nails so bruised and torn,
Knowing Thy suff'ring was for me,
In grief I cry, "How can it be?"

-----

How can it be? How can it be?
That God should love a soul like me,
O how can it be?

-----

How can it be? How can it be?
Was ever grace so full and free!
From heights of bliss to depths of woe
In loving kindness Thou didst go,
From sin and shame to rescue me—
O Love Divine, How can it be? 

-----

How can it be? How can it be?
That God should love a soul like me,
O how can it be?
