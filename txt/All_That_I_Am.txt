# All That I Am

All that I am
I lay before You; 
all I possess,
Lord, I confess 
is nothing without You.

-----

Savior and King,
I now enthrone You; 
take my life,
my living sacrifice to You. 

-----

Lord, be the strength
within my weakness;
be the supply
in ev'ry need, 

-----

That I may prove
Your promises to me, 
faithful and true
in word and deed.

-----

All that I am
I lay before You; 
all I possess,
Lord I confess 
is nothing without You.

-----

Saviour and King,
I now enthrone You;
take my life,
my living sacrifice to You.  

-----

Into Your hands
I place the future; 
The past is nailed
to Calvary, 
 

-----

That I may live
in resurrection power, 
No longer I
but Christ in me.
 

-----

All that I am
I lay before You; 
all I possess,
Lord I confess 
is nothing without You.

-----

Saviour and King,
I now enthrone You; 
take my life,
my living sacrifice to You.
