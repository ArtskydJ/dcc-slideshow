# Come, Let Us Sing of a Wonderful Love

Come, let us sing of a wonderful love,
tender and true; 
out of the heart of the Father above, streaming to me and to you: 
wonderful love
dwells in the heart of the Father above.

-----

Jesus the Savior this Gospel to tell,
joyfully came;
came with the helpless and hopeless to dwell,
sharing their sorrow and shame;
seeking the lost,
saving, redeeming at measureless cost.

-----

Come to my heart, O Thou wonderful love,
come and abide,
lifting my life, till it rises above
envy and falsehood and pride,
Seeking to be,
lowly and humble, a learner of Thee.
