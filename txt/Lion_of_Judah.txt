# Lion of Judah 

Lion of Judah on the throne,
I shout Your name, let it be known
That You are the King of kings,
You are the Prince of Peace,
May Your kingdom's reign never cease. 
Hail to the King! 
Hail to the King!

-----

Lion of Judah come to earth,
I want to thank You for Your birth,
For the living Word,
For Your death on the tree,
For Your resurrection victory. 
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

-----

Lion of Judah on the throne,
from God's Right hand let it be known;
Over all the earth and heav'n,
All pow'r to You is giv'n,
May the nations come to Your throne.
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

-----

Lion of Judah on the throne,
I shout Your name, let it be known;
That You are the King of kings,
You are the Prince of Peace,
May Your kingdom's reign never cease. 
Hail to the King! 
Hail to the King!
You are my King!
