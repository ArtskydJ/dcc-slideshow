# Psalm 59

I wait for You, because You are my strength,
 a mighty fort, a stronghold is my God
My loving God, my God, will meet with me,
and let me look in triumph on my foes.

-----

Let sinful deeds and lies catch up with them,
because of lies and curses that they speak.
In wrath consume that they may be no more;
let all earth know that God in Jacob rules.

-----

But as for me, I'll sing about Your strength,
each day with joy, sing of Your steadfast love;
For You have been my fortress, my defense,
my refuge when the times of trouble come.
