# Lord, You're Lovely

There are times that I behold your beauty,
there are times I don't see you at all.
Open my eyes Lord and teach me to taste and see,
you're everything my all in all.

-----

Lord you're lovely,
may you be the fragrance of my life;
Lord you're worthy,
the spotless Lamb my sacrifice.
You are holy, a purifying fire for my soul.
You are Jesus, and your name is wonderful.

-----

Lord I see you seated on the throne,
and the train of your robe fills the temple.
You bathe the earth in your glory most holy God.
You touch my lips and I am still.

-----

Lord you're lovely,
may you be the fragrance of my life;
Lord you're worthy,
the spotless Lamb my sacrifice.
You are holy, a purifying fire for my soul.
You are Jesus, and your name is wonderful.

-----

Counselor 
Prince of Peace
Mighty God
are you Lord.

-----

Lovely
Worthy
Holy
are you Lord.

-----

Lord you're lovely,
may you be the fragrance of my life;
Lord you're worthy,
the spotless Lamb my sacrifice.
You are holy, a purifying fire for my soul.
You are Jesus, and your name is wonderful.
