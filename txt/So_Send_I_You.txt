# So Send I You 

So send I you- by grace made strong to triumph
o'er hosts of hell o'er darkness,
death, and sin, my name to bear,
and in that name to conquer-
so send I you, my victory to win.

-----

So send I you- to take to souls in bondage
the word of truth that sets the captive free,
to break the bonds of sin,
to loose death's fetters-
so send I you, to bring the lost to me.

-----

So send I you- my strength to know in weakness,
my joy in grief, my perfect peace in pain,
to prove my pow'r, my grace,
my promised presence-
so send I you, eternal fruit to gain.

-----

So send I you- to bear my cross with patience,
and then one with joy to lay it down,
to hear my voice,
 "Well done, my faithful servant-
come share my throne,
 my kingdom, and my crown!"
