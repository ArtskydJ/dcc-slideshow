# Shout to the Lord

My Jesus,
my Savior,
Lord, there is none like you;
all of my days
I want to praise
the wonders of your mighty love.

-----

My comfort,
my shelter,
tower of refuge and strength; 
let ev'ry breath,
all that I am,
never cease to worship you.

-----

Shout to the Lord, all the earth, let us sing power and majesty, praise to the King;
mountains bow down and the seas will roar
at the sound of your name.

-----

I sing for joy at the work of your hands,
forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand,
nothing compares to the promise I have in you.

O Mighty
Lord Jesus,
Beautiful Savior and friend,
O son of God,
and Son of Man. 
O Ruler of all nature.

-----

Thee will I
now cherish,
Thee will I honor and love.
Thou my soul's joy.
Glory and crown,
here I am to worship You

Shout to the Lord, all the earth, let us sing power and majesty, praise to the King;
mountains bow down and the seas will roar
at the sound of your name.

-----

I sing for joy at the work of your hands,
forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand, 
nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
