# Crown Him with Many Crowns / Up from the Grave

Crown Him with many crowns,
the Lamb upon His throne. 
Hark! how the heav'nly anthem drowns
all music but its own!

-----

Awake, my soul, and sing
of Him who died for thee, 
and hail Him as Thy matchless King
through all eternity.

-----

Crown Him the Lord of Love;
behold His hands and side—
rich wounds, yet visible above,
in beauty glorified.

-----

No angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight, 
but downward bends his wondr'ing eye
at mysteries so bright.

-----

Low in the grave he lay,
Jesus, my Savior, 
waiting the coming day,
Jesus, my Lord.

-----

Up from the grave he arose,
(He arose)
with a mighty triumph o'er his foes.
(He arose)

-----

He arose a victor from the dark domain
and he lives forever with his saints to reign. 
He arose!
(He arose!) 
He arose!
(He arose!) 
Hallelujah! Christ arose!

-----

Vainly they watch his bed,
Jesus, my Savior; 
vainly they seal the dead,
Jesus, my Lord.

-----

Up from the grave he arose,
(He arose)
with a mighty triumph o'er his foes.
(He arose)

-----

He arose a victor from the dark domain
and he lives forever with his saints to reign. 
He arose!
(He arose!) 
He arose!
(He arose!) 
Hallelujah! Christ arose!

-----

Death cannot keep his prey,
Jesus, my Savior; 
he tore the bars away,
Jesus, my Lord.

Up from the grave he arose,
(He arose)
with a mighty triumph o'er his foes.
(He arose)

-----

He arose a victor from the dark domain
and he lives forever with his saints to reign. 
He arose!
(He arose!) 
He arose!
(He arose!) 
Hallelujah! Christ arose!

-----

Crown Him the Lord of Life,
who triumphed o'er the grave; 
who rose victorious through the strife
for those he came to save.

-----

His glories now we sing,
who died and rose on high,
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die.

-----

Crown Him the Lord of Love;
behold His hands and side—
rich wounds, yet visible above,
in beauty glorified.

-----

All hail, Redeemer hail!
For Thou hast died for me. 
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
through all eternity! Amen!
