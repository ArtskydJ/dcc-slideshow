# Depth of Mercy

Depth of mercy can there be,
mercy reaching even me?
God the Just his wrath forbears,
me, the chief of sinners spares.

-----

So many times my heart has strayed
from his kind and perfect ways,
making clear my desp'rate need
for his blood poured out for me.

-----

Give me grace, Lord, let me own
all the wrongs that I have done.
Let me now my sins deplore,
look to you and sin no more.

-----

There for me the Savior stands
holding forth his wounded hands;
Scars which ever cry for me,
once condemned but now set free.
