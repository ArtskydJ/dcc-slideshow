# Psalm 50B

O you My people hear!
I'll speak and testify 
against you now O Israel; F
or God your God am I.

-----

I'm not rebuking you
For lack of sacrifice;
Nor for burnt off'rings which you place
Each day before My eyes.

-----

I need no bull nor goat
Which you in pens confine;
For cattle on a thousand hills,
And all wild beasts are Mine.

-----

Birds in the mountains high
 Are all to Me well known;
The beasts that roam the wilds untamed,
They too are all my own.

-----

If I were hungry now
I would no speak to you,
Because the world belongs to Me,
And all that's in it too.

-----

Will I eat flesh of bulls?
Or goats blood drink will I?
Make thankfulness your sacrifice;
Pay vows to God Most High.

-----

And always call on Me
The day you trouble see;
For I will then deliver you
That you may honor Me.
