# Fairest Lord Jesus

Fairest Lord Jesus,
Ruler of all nature,
Son of God and Son of Man! 
Thee will I cherish,
thee will I honor,
thou, my soul's glory, joy, and crown.

-----

Fair are the meadows,
fair are the woodlands,
robed in the blooming garb of spring: 
Jesus is fairer,
Jesus is purer,
who makes the woeful heart to sing.

-----

Beautiful Savior!
Lord of the nations!
Son of God and Son of Man! 
Glory and honor,
praise, adoration,
now and for evermore be thine.
