# How Shall the Young Direct Their Way?

How shall the young direct their way?
What light shall be their perfect guide? Your word, O Lord, will safely lead,
if in its wisdom they confide. 
Sincerely I have sought you, Lord,
O let me not from you depart;
to know your will and keep from sin
your word I cherish in my heart.

-----

O blessed Lord, teach me your law,
your righteous judgements I declare;
your testimonies make me glad,
for they are wealth beyond compare.
Upon your precepts and your ways
my heart will meditate with awe;
your word shall be my chief delight,
and I will not forget your law.

> Words: the psalter, 1912
