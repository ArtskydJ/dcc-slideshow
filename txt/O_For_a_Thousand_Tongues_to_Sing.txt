# O For a Thousand Tongues to Sing

O for a thousand tongues to sing
my great Redeemer's praise,
the glories of my God and King,
the triumphs of His grace. 

-----

My gracious Master and my God,
assist me to proclaim; 
to spread through all the earth abroad,
the honors of thy Name.

-----

Jesus, the Name that calms our fears,
that bids our sorrows cease; 
'tis music in the sinner's ears,
'tis life, and health, and peace.

-----

He breaks the pow'r of reigning sin,
He sets the prisoner free; 
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me.

-----

He speaks and, listening to His voice,
new life the dead receive; 
the mournful, broken hearts rejoice;
the humble poor believe.

-----

Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
your loosened tongues employ; 
ye blind, behold your Saviour come;
and leap, ye lame, for joy!
