# Of the Father's Love Begotten 

Of the Father's love begotten
Ere the worlds began to be,
He is Alpha and Omega,
He the Source, the Ending He,
Of the things that are, that ha- - - -ve been
And that future years shall see 
Evermore and evermore!

-----

O that birth forever blessed,
When the Virgin, full of grace,
By the Holy Ghost conceiving,
Bore the Savior of our race;
And the babe, the world's Redee- - - -mer,
First revealed His sacred face, 
Evermore and evermore!

-----

This is He whom heav'n-taught singers Sang of old with one accord,
Whom the Scriptures of the prophets Promised in their faithful word;
Now He shines, the long-expec- - - - ted;
Let creation praise its Lord, 
Evermore and evermore!

-----

O ye heights of heav'n, adore him;
Angel hosts, His praises sing;
All dominions, bow before Him
And extol our God and King;
Let no tongue on earth be si- - - - lent,
Ev'ry voice in concert ring, 
Evermore and evermore!

-----

Christ, to Thee, with God the Father,
And, O Holy Ghost, to Thee,
Hymn, and chant, and high thanksgiving, And unwearied praises be,
Honor, glory, and domi- - - -nion,
And eternal victory 
Evermore and evermore!
