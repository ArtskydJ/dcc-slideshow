# Psalm 34A

At all times I will bless the LORD
In praise my mouth employ, 
My soul is boasting in the LORD
the poor will hear with joy.
O glorify the LORD with me
let us exalt His name!
In all my fears I sought the LORD
from Him my rescue came.

-----

They looked to Him and radiant were
ashamed they shall not be.
The LORD heard when this poor man cried
from trouble set him free.
The angel of the LORD encamps
around those fearing Him; 
Those trusting Him He safely guards
and He delivers them.

-----

O taste and see the LORD is good
those trusting Him are blessed. 
O fear the LORD, saints; none who fear
will be with need oppressed. 
The lions young may hungry be
and they may lack their food;
But they who truly seek the LORD
will not lack any good.
