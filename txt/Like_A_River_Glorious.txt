# Like a River Glorious

Like a river glorious, is God's perfect peace,
over all victorious, in its bright increase;
perfect, yet it floweth, fuller every day,
perfect, yet it groweth, deeper all the way.

-----

Stayed upon Jehovah,
hearts are fully blest
finding, as he promised,
perfect peace and rest.

-----

Hidden in the hollow of his blessed hand,
never foe can follow, never traitor stand;
not a surge of worry, not a shade of care,
not a blast of hurry touch the spirit there.

-----

Stayed upon Jehovah,
hearts are fully blest
finding, as he promised,
perfect peace and rest.

-----

Every joy or trial falleth from above,
traced upon our dial by the Sun of Love;
we may trust him fully all for us to do.
They who trust him wholly find him wholly true. 

-----

Stayed upon Jehovah,
hearts are fully blest
finding, as he promised,
perfect peace and rest.
