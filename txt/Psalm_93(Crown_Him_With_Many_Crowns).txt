# Psalm 93 

The LORD is crowned as King.
He's clothed with majesty. 
The LORD has clothed Himself with might And great authority. 
The world is firmly set,
And never moved can be. 
And long established is Your throne,
You're from eternity.

-----

The floods lift up, O LORD;
The floods lift up their voice, 
The floods are lifting up their waves;
They make a mighty noise. 
But yet the LORD on high
Of greater strength is He 
Than is the thunder of the waves,
Or breakers of the sea.

> Music: George Elvey, Words, David bar Jesse
