# Let The Earth Resound

Let the earth resound with songs of praise
to the Father's pow'r and love.
For the One who set each star in place
chose to set His heart on us.
To the One whose might gives victory
yet whose mercies never cease,
As the tapestry of history
tells the story of His grace.

-----

King immortal, faithful God,
crowned with splendor, rich in love.
Let the heavens and the earth resound
with songs of praise to You.

-----

Let the earth be stilled before the sight
of a Father's sacrifice,
that revealed the depths of love divine
in the face of Jesus Christ.
Through a life of full obedience,
and a death in agony,
He removed the rebel's punishment
and He set the pris'ner free.

-----

King immortal, faithful God,
crowned with splendor, rich in love.
Let the heavens and the earth resound
with songs of praise to You.

-----

Let the earth resound with song of faith
at the wonder yet to come,
When all sin and pain are put to death
and the church and Christ are one.
When we stand as God's great family
and we meet the Father's gaze
And we share in His eternal joy
as we join in ceaseless praise.

-----

King immortal, faithful God,
crowned with splendor, rich in love.
Let the heavens and the earth resound
with songs of praise to You.
