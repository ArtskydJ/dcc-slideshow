# Lord, I Lift Your Name on High (Psalm 113)

Lord, I lift Your name on high.
Lord, I love to sing Your praises. 
I'm so glad You're in my life;
I'm so glad You came to save us. 

-----

You came from heaven to earth
to show the way, 
from the earth to the cross
my debt to pay; 
from the cross to the grave,
from the grave to the sky,
Lord, I lift Your name on high. 

-----

Praise Jehovah praise the Lord,
praise, O servants of the Lord. 
Blessed be Jehovah's name,
evermore His praise proclaim. 

-----

From this time forth
and forevermore be praised, 
from the dawn to setting sun
God's name be praised. 
Over all nations He is high,
Yea, His glory crowns the sky 
Who is like the Lord our God.

-----

Who is like the Lord our God,
high in heaven His dwelling place is, 
who himself doth humble low,
things in heaven and earth to know. 

-----

You make the lowly to rise
up from the dust, 
and You lift the needy up
from ashes, 
that exalted He may stand,
with the princes of the land. 
He the childless woman takes,
and a joyful mother makes. 
Praise Jehovah, praise the Lord.
