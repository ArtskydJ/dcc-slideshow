# We Proclaim Your Kingdom Come

The earth resounds in songs of praise; creation shouts Your glorious name,
and the skies speak forth Your majesty,
and the heavens declare Your glory.

-----

Your kingdom rules from age to age;
every tribe and tongue shall bring You praise,
and we come to bow before the throne
of the Lord of the heavens and earth. 

-----

Jesus, King of kings,
Jesus, Lord of lords,
we proclaim Your kingdom come, 
Jesus, Son of God. 
Lord, enthroned on high
above the heavens and the earth,
we proclaim Your kingdom come!
