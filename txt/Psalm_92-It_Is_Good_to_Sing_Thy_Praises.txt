# Psalm 92

It is good to sing Thy praises
And to thank Thee O Most High, 
Showing forth Thy loving kindness
When the morning lights the sky.
It is good when night is falling
Of thy faithfulness to tell,
While with sweet melodious praises
Songs of adoration swell.

-----

Thou has filled my heart with gladness
Thro the works Thy hands have wrought;
Thou hast made my life victorious,
Great Thy works and deep Thy thought.
Thou, O lord on high exalted,
Reignest evermore in might;
All Thy enemies shall perish,

-----

But the good shall live before Thee,
Planted in Thy dwelling place,
Fruitful trees and ever verdant,
Nourished by Thy boundless grace.
In His goodness to the righteous God
His righteousness displays,
God my Rock my Strength my Refuge,
Just and true are all His ways.
