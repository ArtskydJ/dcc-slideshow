# As We Come With Praise

As we come with praise before His majesty, we will celebrate with joy and victory, 
for the Lord has come
and set His people free, 
we are marching on with Him;
He's our deliverer.

The two-edged sword is sharpen'd in our hand.
We come with vengeance to possess our land. 
We bind the kings because of God's right hand, and we carry out the sentence
that our God has plann'd.

Be strong in the Lord and in His mighty pow'r
put on the whole armour of God for each hour. 
To fight against spiritual evil pow'rs,
we're praying in the Spirit God's vic'try is ours.

He's our deliverer,
He's our deliverer,
He's our deliverer,
You're our deliverer!
