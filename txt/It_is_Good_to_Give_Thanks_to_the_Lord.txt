# It is Good to Give Thanks to the Lord

It is good to give thanks to the Lord,
to remember all He has done; 
then God will remember our praises
when He looks with love on His people.
Our sin is the sin of our fathers,
we've done wrong, we all have been evil; 
like those who once lived in bondage
we paid no heed to all You had done.

-----

O give thanks to the Lord,
for His love endures forever. 
O give thanks to the Lord,
for the Lord alone is good.

-----

Our fathers forsook Your love,
at the Red Sea they questioned their God; 
they fell from their faith in the desert,
and put God to the test in the wilderness.
Time after time He would rescue them,
yet in malice they dared to defy Him; 
despite this He came to their aid
when He heard their cries of distress.  

-----

O give thanks to the Lord,
for His love endures forever. 
O give thanks to the Lord,
for the Lord alone is good.

-----

Save us, O Lord, in Your love; 
bring us back from all that offends You. 
Look not alone at our sins,
but remember Your promise of mercy.
Blessed be the God of Israel
both now and through all eternity; 
Let nations and people cry out
and sing Amen! Alleluia!

-----

O give thanks to the Lord,
for His love endures forever. 
O give thanks to the Lord,
for the Lord alone is good.
