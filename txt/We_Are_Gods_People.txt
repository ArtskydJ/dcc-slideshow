# We Are God's People

We are God's people, the chosen of the Lord born of his Spirit, established by his Word; our cornerstone is Christ alone,
and strong in him we stand: 
O let us live transparently, and walk
heart to heart and hand in hand.

-----

We are God's loved ones,
the Bride of Christ our Lord,
for we have known it,
the love of God outpoured; 
now let us learn how to return
the gift of love once giv'n
O let us share each joy and care and live
with a zeal that pleases heav'n.

-----

We are the Body of which the Lord is head, called to obey him, now risen from the dead; he wills us be a family, diverse yet truly one; 
O let us give our gifts to God, and so
shall his work on earth be done.

-----

We are a temple, the Spirit's dwelling place, formed in great weakness,
a cup to hold God's grace;
we die alone, for on its own
each member loses fire: 
yet joined in one the flame burns on to give
warmth and light, and to inspire.
