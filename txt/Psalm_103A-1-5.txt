# O Bless the Lord, My Soul (Psalm 103:1-5)

O bless the Lord, my soul
His blessedness proclaim.
Let all that is within me join
to bless His holy name.

-----

O bless the Lord my soul,
His mercies bear in mind;
Forget not all the ways in which
He has to you been kind.

-----

He pardons and forgives
all your iniquities.
He from each sickness makes you well
and heals you from disease.

-----

He purchases your life
to raise you from the dead.
A crown of mercy and of love
He places on your head.

-----

With good things, your desires
He fully satisfies;
and therefore, like an eagle, you
with youth renewed, arise.
