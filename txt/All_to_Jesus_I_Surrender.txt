# All to Jesus I Surrender

All to Jesus I surrender,
all to Him I freely give; 
may I ever love and trust Him,
in His presence daily live.

-----

I surrender all,
I surrender all.
All to Thee,
my blessed Savior,
I surrender all.

-----

All to Jesus I surrender,
humbly at His feet I bow, 
worldly pleasures all forsaken,
take me, Jesus, take me now.

-----

I surrender all,
I surrender all.
All to Thee,
my blessed Savior,
I surrender all.

-----

All to Jesus I surrender,
make me, Savior, wholly Thine;
May Thy Holy Spirit fill me,
may I know Thy power divine.

-----

I surrender all,
I surrender all.
All to Thee,
my blessed Savior,
I surrender all.

-----

All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
let Thy blessing fall on me.

-----

I surrender all,
I surrender all.
All to Thee,
my blessed Savior,
I surrender all.
