# The Earth Shakes

The earth shakes at the sound of his voice,
the nations tremble before him.
The idols of men are all falling,
at the feet of the Lord our God,
at the feet of the Lord our God.

-----

The Lord is a warrior fearless is he
the Lord is mighty in battle.
His armies outnumber his enemies,
when they shout the strongholds
Of Satan come crashing down,
and Babylon is falling falling down

-----

The earth shakes at the sound of His voice,
the nations tremble before him.
The idols of men are all falling,
at the feet of the Lord our God,
at the feet of the Lord our God.

-----

The Lord is a Savior gracious is he,
the Lord is full of compassion.
His army is also His family,
when they shout the strongholds
of Satan come crashing down,
and Babylon is falling falling down.

-----

The earth shakes at the sound of His voice,
the nations tremble before him.
The idols of men are all falling
at the feet of the Lord our God, 
at the feet of the Lord our God.

-----

The Lord has a kingdom Jesus is King;
we reign forever and ever.
He's given us power and authority.
when we shout the strongholds
of Satan come crashing down,
and Babylon is falling falling down.

-----

The earth shakes at the sound of his voice,
the nations tremble before him.
The idols of men are all falling,
at the feet of the Lord, our God,
at the feet of the Lord, our God.
At the feet of the Lord, our God.
