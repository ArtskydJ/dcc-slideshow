# O God, Give Us Your Blessing (Psalm 67)

O God, give us Your blessing,
extend to us Your grace; 
and cause to shine upon us
the radiance of Your face;

-----

In order that Your pathways would
through the earth be known, 
that You to every nation would
Your salvation show.

-----

O God, let peoples praise You;
let all the peoples praise. 
Let nations come rejoicing
and songs of gladness raise;

-----

For You will judge the peoples
with perfect equity; 
You will for all earth's nations
their guide and leader be.

-----

O God, let peoples praise You;
let all the peoples praise.
The earth has brought its bounty
throughout its harvest days;

-----

Since God, our God, will bless us;
yes, God will blessing send;
That all the earth may fear Him
to its remotest end.
