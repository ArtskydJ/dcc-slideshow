# Now Unto Jehovah, Ye Sons of the Mighty

Now unto Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty,
all glory and strength and dominion accord; 
ascribe to Him glory, and render Him honor.
In beauty of holiness worship the Lord.

-----

The voice of Jehovah
comes down on the waters;
in thunder the God of the glory draws nigh.
Lo, over the waves of the wide flowing waters
Jehovah as King is enthroned on high!

-----

Now unto Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty,
all glory and strength and dominion accord; 
ascribe to Him glory, and render Him honor.
In beauty of holiness worship the Lord.

-----

The voice of Jehovah is mighty, is mighty;
the voice of Jehovah in majesty speaks:
the voice of Jehovah the cedars is breaking;
Jehovah the cedars of Lebanon breaks.

-----

Now unto Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty,
all glory and strength and dominion accord; 
ascribe to Him glory, and render Him honor.
In beauty of holiness worship the Lord.

-----

Each one in His temple His glory proclaimeth.
He sat on the flood; He is King on His throne. 
Jehovah all strength to His people imparteth;
Jehovah with peace ever blesseth His own.

-----

Now unto Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty,
all glory and strength and dominion accord; 
ascribe to Him glory, and render Him honor.
In beauty of holiness worship the Lord.
