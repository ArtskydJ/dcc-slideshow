# Let Your Kingdom Come 

Your glorious cause O God,
engages our hearts. 
May Jesus Christ be known
wherever we are. 
We ask not for ourselves
but for your renown. 
The cross has saved us so we pray,
"Your kingdom come."

-----

Let Your kingdom come,
let Your will be done;
so that everyone
might know Your name.
Let Your song be heard
everywhere on earth,
till Your sovereign work on earth is done.
Let Your kingdom come.

-----

Give us Your strength O God,
and courage to speak. 
Perform Your wondrous deeds
through those who are weak. 
Lord use us as You want,
whatever the test.
By grace we'll preach Your gospel till
our dying breath.

-----

Let Your kingdom come,
let Your will be done;
so that everyone
might know Your name.
Let Your song be heard
everywhere on earth,
till Your sovereign work on earth is done.

-----

Let Your kingdom come,
let Your will be done; 
so that everyone
might know Your name.
Let Your song be heard
everywhere on earth,
till Your sovereign work on earth is done.
Let Your kingdom come.
Let Your kingdom come!
