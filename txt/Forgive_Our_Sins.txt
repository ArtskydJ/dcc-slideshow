# Forgive Our Sins

"Forgive our sins as we forgive,"
You taught us, Lord, to pray;
But You alone can give us grace
to live the words we say. 
How can Your pardon reach and
bless the unforgiving heart 
that broods on wrongs and will not
let old bitterness depart?

-----

In blazing lights Your cross reveals
the truth we dimly know.
How small the debts men owe to us,
how great our debt to You.
Lord cleanse the depths within our souls,
and bid resentment cease.
Then reconciled to God and man
our lives will spread Your peace.
