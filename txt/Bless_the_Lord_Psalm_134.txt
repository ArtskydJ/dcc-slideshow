# Psalm 134 (Bless the Lord) 

Bless the Lord, all you His servants, 
as you serve with one accord; 
Bless the Lord in your night watches 
in the dwelling of the Lord. 

-----

Lift your hands within His temple; 
bless the Lord, and raise them high.
May the Lord bless you from Zion,
He who made both earth and sky.
