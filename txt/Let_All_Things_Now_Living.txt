# Let All Things Now Living

Let all thing now living a song of thanksgiving
to God the Creator triumphantly raise,
Who fashioned and made us,
protected and stayed us,
Who guides us and leads
to the end of our days.

-----

His banners are o'er us, his light goes before us,
a pillar of fire shining forth in the night,
'til shadows have vanished
and darkness is banished,
As forward we travel from light into light.

-----

His law he enforces: the stars in their courses,
the sun in its orbit, obediently shine;
the hills and the mountains,
the rivers and fountains,
The deeps of the ocean
proclaim Him divine.

-----

We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing,
with glad adoration a song let us raise,
'til all things now living
unite in thanksgiving
to God in the highest,
hosanna and praise!
