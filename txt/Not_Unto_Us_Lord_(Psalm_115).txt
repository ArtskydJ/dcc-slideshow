# Not unto us, Lord (Psalm 115)

Not unto us, Lord, no, not us,
but to Your name above,
bring glory for Your faithfulness
and for Your steadfast love.

-----

Why should the heathen nations say,
"Why does their God keep still?"
for our God lives in heaven high,
and carries out His will.

-----

Of gold and silver are their gods,
which men craft carefully,
and give them mouths that cannot speak
and eyes that cannot see.

-----

Though they have ears, they cannot hear;
their nose no scent has found.
Their hands can't feel, their feet can't walk;
their throats can make no sound.

-----

Whoever makes these lifeless gods-
these idols which are vain-
whoever puts his trust in them
in time becomes the same.
