# Psalm 118:1-9

O thank the Lord, for He is good,
His gracious love endures. 
O let all Israel now say,
"His gracious love endures."

-----

O let the house of Aaron say, |
"His gracious love endures." 
Let those who fear the Lord now say,
"His gracious love endures."

-----

In anguish to the Lord I cried;
the Lord then set me free.
The Lord's with me, I will not fear.
What harm can man do me?

-----

The Lord supports me at my side,
He gives His help to me;
and so in triumph I will look
on all those hating me.

-----

O better far to trust the Lord
than on man's help rely.
Yes, better far to trust the Lord
than men whose rank is high.
