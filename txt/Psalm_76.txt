# Psalm 76

God the LORD is known in Judah;
great his name in Israel; 
his pavilion is in Salem,
his abode on Zion hill.
There he broke the bow and arrows,
bade the sword and shield be still.

-----

Excellent art thou and glorious
coming from the hills of prey.
Thou hast spoiled the valiant hearted;
wrapt in sleep of death are they.
Mighty men have lost their cunning;
none are ready for the fray.

-----

Horse and chariot low are lying
in the sleep of death's dark night.
Jacob's God, thou didst rebuke them;
thou art fearful in thy might.
When thine anger once is risen,
who may stand before thy sight?

-----

When from heav'n thy sentence sounded,
all the earth in fear was still;
while to save the meek and lowly
God in judgment wrought his will.
Ev'n the wrath of man shall praise thee;
what remains is kept from ill.

-----

Make your vows now to Jehovah,
pay your God what is his own.
All men, bring your gifts before him;
fear is due to him alone.
He brings low the pride of princes;
kings of earth shall be in awe.
