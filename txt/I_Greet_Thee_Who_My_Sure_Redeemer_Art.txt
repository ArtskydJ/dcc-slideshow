# I Greet Thee, Who My Sure Redeemer Art

I greet Thee, who my sure Redeemer art,
my only trust and Savior of my heart,
who pain didst undergo for my poor sake;
I pray Thee from our hearts all cares to take.

-----

Thou art the King of mercy and of grace,
reigning omnipotent in every place;
so come, O King, and our whole being sway;
shine on us with the light of Thy pure day.

-----

Thou art the life, by which alone we live,
and all our substance and our strength receive;
O comfort us in death's approaching hour,
strong-hearted then to face it by Thy pow'r.

-----

Thou hast the true and perfect gentleness,
no harshness hast Thou and no bitterness;
make us to taste the sweet grace found in Thee
and ever stay in Thy sweet unity.

-----

Our hope is in no other save in Thee;
our faith is built upon Thy promise free;
O grant to us such stronger hope and sure
that we can boldly conquer and endure.
