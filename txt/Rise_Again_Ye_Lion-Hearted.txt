# Rise Again, Ye Lion-Hearted

Rise again ye lion hearted saints of early Christendom. 
Wither is your strength departed, wither gone your martyrdom? 
Lo, love's light is on them, glory's flame upon them, 
and their will to die doth quell
e'em the lord and prince of hell.

-----

These the saints by fear unshaken facing danger dauntlessly; 
these no witching lust hath taken, lust that lures to vanity. 
Mid the roar and rattle of tumultuous battle in desire they soar above 
all that earth would have them Love.

-----

Great of heart, they know no turning honor, gold, they laugh to scorn, 
quench desires within them burning, by no earthly passion torn. 
Mid the lions roaring, songs of praise outpouring, 
joyously they take their stand
on th'arena's bloody sand.

-----

Would to God that I might even as the martyred saints of old, 
with the helping hand of Heaven, steadfast stand in battle bold! 
O my God, I pray Thee, in the combat stay me. 
Grant that I may ever be
loyal, staunch, and true to Thee.
