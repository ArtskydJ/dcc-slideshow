# All For Jesus

All for Jesus, all for Jesus,
all my being's ransomed powers;
all my thoughts and words and doings
all my days and all my hours.

-----

Let my hands perform His bidding,
let my feet run in His ways;
let my eyes see Jesus only,
let my lips speak forth His praise.

-----

Worldlings prize their gems of beauty,
cling to gilded toys of dust.
Boast of wealth and fame and pleasure-
only Jesus will I trust.

-----

Since my eyes were fixed on Jesus
I've lost sight of all beside.
So enchained my spirit's vision
looking at the Crucified.

-----

Oh, what wonder! How amazing!
Jesus, glorious King of Kings,
Deigns to call me His beloved,
lets me rest beneath His wings.
