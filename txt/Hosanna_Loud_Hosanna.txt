# Hosanna, Loud Hosanna 

Hosanna loud hosanna The little children sang: Through pillared court and temple 
The lovely anthem rang: To Jesus who had blessed them Close folded to His breast,
The children sang their praises, the simplest and the best.

-----

From Olivet they followed Mid an exultant
Crowd, The victor palm branch waving, And chanting clear and loud; The Lord of men and angels Rode on in lowly state, Nor scorned that little children Should on His bidding wait.

-----

Hosanna in the highest That ancient song we sing, For Christ is our Redeemer, The Lord of heav'n, our King; O may we ever praise Him With heart and life and voice, And in His blissful presence Eternally rejoice!
