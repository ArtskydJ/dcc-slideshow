# Blessed Be the Lord God Almighty / Jesus Shall Take the Highest Honor

Father in heaven, how we love You,
we lift Your name in all the earth.
May Your kingdom
be established in our praises, 
as Your people declare Your mighty works.

Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
Who was, and is, and is to come.
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
Who reigns forevermore.

Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
who was, and is, and is to come;
blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
who reigns forevermore.

Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
who was, and is, and is to come;
blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
who reigns forevermore.

For at His name every knee must bow.
Let every tongue confess 
He is Christ, God's only Son,
Sovereign Lord we give You glory now.

For all honor and blessing and power
belongs to You, belongs to You. 
All honor and blessing and power
belongs to You, belongs to You,
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God.
