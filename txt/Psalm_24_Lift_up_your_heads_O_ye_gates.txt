# Psalm 24

Lift up your heads, O ye gates and be lifted up, O ancient doors, 
that the King of Glory may come in.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates and be lifted up, O ancient doors, 
that the King of Glory may come in.

-----

The earth is the Lord's and the fullness there-of, the world and those who dwell there-in 
He has founded it upon the seas and has established it upon the rivers

-----

Lift up your heads, O ye gates and be lifted up, O ancient doors, 
that the King of Glory may come in.

-----

Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord and stand in his holy place? 
He who has clean hands and a pure heart,
who does not lift up his soul to what is false

-----

Lift up your heads, O ye gates and be lifted up, O ancient doors, 
that the King of Glory may come in.

-----

The blessing of the Lord is theirs and peace from the God of their salvation. 
Such is the people who seek him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob.

-----

Lift up your heads, O ye gates and be lifted up, O ancient doors, 
that the King of Glory may come in.

-----

Who is the King of Glory?
The Lord strong and mighty in battle. 
Who is this King of Glory? The Lord of hosts is his name

-----

Lift up your heads, O ye gates and be lifted up, O ancient doors, 
that the King of Glory may come in.
That the King of Glory may come in.
