# Song of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)

Praised be the God of Israel,
Who has redeemed his people;
Through David's house God will excel
And triumph over evil.

-----

As told by prophets long ago,
He frees us from the hateful foe,
Shows mercy to our parents. 
God's cov'nant oath will persevere,
That we may serve him without fear
Each day in true obedience.

-----

My child, you will prepare God's way
As prophet of the Most High,
Announce to people that the day
Of saving knowledge is nigh.

-----

In tender mercy God begins
To save his people from their sins,
From death and desolation. 
The light will make the darkness cease
And guide our feet in ways of peace;
The Lord brings us salvation.
