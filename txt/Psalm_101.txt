# Psalm 101

Of mercy and of justice
O LORD I'll sing to Thee.
In uprightness and wisdom
shall my behavior be.
O when in lovingkindness
wilt Thou to me come near?
I'll walk within my dwelling
with heart and life sincere.

-----

I will permit no base thing
 before my eyes to be.
I hate unfaithful doing
it shall not cleave to me.
The man whose heart is froward
shall from my presence go;
And nothing that is evil
will I consent to know.

-----

I'll cut him off that slanders
 his neighbor secretly;
I'll not endure the proud heart
nor eyes that haughty be.
My eyes are with the faithful
that he may dwell with me;
The man whose walk is upright
my minister shall be.

-----

No man of works deceitful
within my house shall dwell;
Nor in my sight shall tarry
a man who lies will tell.
Each moring with destruction
the wicked I'll reward,
To free from evil-doers
the city of the LORD
