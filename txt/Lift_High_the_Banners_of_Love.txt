# Lift High The Banners of Love 

Lift high the banners of love, Hallelujah!
Sound the trumpets of war,
Christ has gotten us the victr'y. Hallelujah!
Jericho must fall.

-----

The body of Christ is an army
fighting powers unseen,
Bringing the captives to freedom
in the name of Jesus, our King.

-----

Lift high the banners of love, Hallelujah!
Sound the trumpets of war,
Christ has gotten us the victr'y. Hallelujah!
Jericho must fall.

-----

Brothers are you sure of your calling?
Will you fight for Jesus, the King?
Are you prepared in this battle
to lay down your lives for your friends?

-----

Lift high the banners of love, Hallelujah!
Sound the trumpets of war,
Christ has gotten us the victr'y. Hallelujah!
Jericho must fall.

-----

We must stand in unity
by the Spirit made strong;
Stand with Jesus our captain,
and fight 'till God's kingdom has come.

-----

Lift high the banners of love, Hallelujah!
Sound the trumpets of war,
Christ has gotten us the victr'y. Hallelujah!
Jericho must fall.

-----

Preach the Savior crucified,
dead, but risen again.
Come against the powers of darkness
in His glorious name.

-----

Lift high the banners of love, Hallelujah!
Sound the trumpets of war,
Christ has gotten us the victr'y. Hallelujah!
Jericho must fall.

-----

In the name of God the Father,
In the name of Jesus His Son,
And in the name of the Spirit,
We will fight 'till we are called home.

-----

Lift high the banners of love, Hallelujah!
Sound the trumpets of war,
Christ has gotten us the victr'y. Hallelujah!
Jericho must fall.
