It is good to give thanks to the LORD,
and to sing praises to thy Name,
O Most High; 
to declare thy lovingkindness in the morning,
and thy faithfulness ev'ry night,
with the ten stringed lute
and upon the harp,
with resounding music on the lyre. 

-----

For thou, O LORD hast made me glad
by what thou hast done, O Most High. 
I will sing for joy at the works of thy hands. How great are thy works O LORD! 

-----

Your thoughts are very deep.
A senseless man can't know,
nor can a foolish person understand.
When wicked sprout like grass,
and evil doers bloom,
it is that they forever be destroyed. 

-----

But you, O LORD, art forever on high.
For behold, your enemies, O LORD, 
for behold, your enemies will perish all,
and evil doers all shall scattered be. 

-----

But you have exalted my horn
like that of a wild ox; 
I have with fresh oil been anointed
and my eyes have looked upon my foes;

-----

My ears have heard the rout
of the wicked ones
who have risen up against me. 
The righteous flourish will
like the palm tree be,
in Lebanon will like a cedar grow. 

-----

Planted in the house
of Jehovah, they
will flourish in the courts that are of God. 
They shall still bear fruit in old age;
they shall be fresh and flourishing,
to declare that upright is the LORD my Rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him!
