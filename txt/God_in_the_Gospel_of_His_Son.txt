# God, in the Gospel of His Son

God, in the gospel of his Son,
makes his eternal counsels known;
where love in all its glory shines,
and truth is drawn in fairest lines.

-----

Here sinners of a humble frame
may taste his grace, and learn his name:
may read, in characters of blood,
the wisdom, pow'r, and grace of God.

-----

The prisoner here may break his chains;
the weary rest from all his pains;
the captive feel his bondage cease;
the mourner find the way of peace.

-----

Here faith reveals to mortal eyes
a brighter world beyond the skies;
here shines the light which guides our way
from earth to realms of endless day.

-----

O grant us grace, Almighty Lord,
to read and mark thy holy Word;
its truths with meekness to receive,
and by its holy precepts live.
