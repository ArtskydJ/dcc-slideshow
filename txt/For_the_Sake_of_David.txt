# For the Sake of David

For the sake of David,
turn your thoughts, O Lord, 
to the things he suffered,
hardships he endured.
Then he made a promise,
vowing to the Lord- 
Mighty One of Jacob-
unto Him he swore:

-----

"My house I'll not enter,
there I'll not repose;
I'll not let my eyes sleep,
nor my eyelids close,
Till I find a dwelling
where the Lord would live-
Mighty One of Jacob-
Him a house I'll give."

-----

It was first in Ephrath
we heard news resound:
In the field of Jaar,
there it had been found.
At his place of dwelling,
let us enter in;
Gathered at His footstool,
let us worship Him.

-----

Lord, now rise and enter
with Your ark of might
To that place of resting,
pleasing in Your sight.
Let Your priesthood serve You,
clothed in righteousness;
Let Your saints with singing
joyfulness express.
