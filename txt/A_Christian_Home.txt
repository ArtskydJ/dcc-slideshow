# A Christian Home

O give us homes built firm upon the Savior,
Where Christ is Head and Counselor and Guide; 
Where ev'ry child is taught His love and favor
And gives his heart to Christ, the crucified.
How sweet to know that though his footsteps waver His faithful Lord is walking by his side!

-----

O give us homes with godly fathers, mothers,
Who always place their hope and trust in Him; 
Whose tender patience turmoil never bothers,
Whose calm and courage trouble cannot dim; 
A home where each finds joy in serving others,
And love still shines, tho' days be dark and grim.

# A Christian Home 

O Lord, our God, our homes are Thine forever! 
We trust to Thee their problems, toil, and care; 
Their bonds of love no enemy can sever
If Thou art always Lord and Master there;
Be Thou the center of our least endeavor,
Be Thou our Guest, our hearts and homes to share.
