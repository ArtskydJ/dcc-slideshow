# Crown Him with Many Crowns

Crown him with many crowns,
the Lamb upon his throne.
Hark! how the heav'nly anthem drowns
all music but its own! 

-----

Awake, my soul, and sing
of him who died for thee,
all hail him as thy matchless King
through all eternity.

-----

Crown him the Lord of life,
who triumphed o'r the grave,
who rose victorious in the strife
for those he came to save.

-----

His glories now we sing,
who died and rose on high;
who died eternal life to bring,
and lives that death may die.

# Low in the Grave

Low in the grave he lay,
Jesus my Savior,
waiting the coming day,
Jesus my Lord!

-----

Up from the grave he arose,
with a mighty triumph o'er his foes,
he arose a Victor from the dark domain,
and he lives forever, with his saints to reign.
He arose! He arose! Hallelujah! Christ arose!

-----

Vainly they watch his bed,
Jesus my Savior;
vainly they seal the dead,
Jesus my Lord!

-----

Up from the grave he arose,
with a mighty triumph o'er his foes,
he arose a Victor from the dark domain,
and he lives forever, with his saints to reign.
He arose! He arose! Hallelujah! Christ arose!

-----

Death cannot keep his Prey,
Jesus my Savior;
he tore the bars away,
Jesus my Lord! 

-----

Up from the grave he arose,
with a mighty triumph o'er his foes,
he arose a Victor from the dark domain,
and he lives forever, with his saints to reign.
He arose! He arose! Hallelujah! Christ arose!

-----

# Crown Him with Many Crowns

Crown him the Lord of peace,
whose power a scepter sways
from pole to pole, that wars may cease, and all be prayer and praise. 

-----

His reign shall know no end;
his triumph will be sure,
his praise and glory shall not fail
through all eternity! AMEN.
