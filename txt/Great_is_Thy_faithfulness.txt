# Great Is Thy Faithfulness (Lam. 3:22, 23)

Great is thy faithfulness,
O God my Father,
there is no shadow of turning with thee;
thou changest not,
thy compassions, they fail not;
as thou hast been thou for ever wilt be.

-----

Great is thy faithfulness!
Great is thy faithfulness! 
Morning by morning new mercies I see:
all I have needed thy hand hath provided,
great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me! 

-----

Summer and winter,
and springtime and harvest,
sun, moon and stars in their courses above,
join with all nature in manifold witness
to thy great faithfulness,
mercy and love. 

-----

Great is thy faithfulness!
Great is thy faithfulness! 
Morning by morning new mercies I see:
all I have needed thy hand hath provided,
great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!

-----

Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
thine own dear presence
to cheer and to guide; 
strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
blessings all mine,
with ten thousand beside!

-----

Great is thy faithfulness!
Great is thy faithfulness! 
Morning by morning new mercies I see:
all I have needed thy hand hath provided,
great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!
