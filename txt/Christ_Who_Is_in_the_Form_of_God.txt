# Christ Who Is in the Form of God

Christ, who is in the form of God,
did not retain His lofty place,
but, taking on a servant's role,
became a member of our race. 

-----

And being found in human form,
humbly He suffered further loss
but willingly accepting death-
yes, even death upon a cross,
yes, even death up-on a cross. 

-----

Therefore has God exalted Him
and raised Him to the highest place 
and given Him that matchless name,
worthy of all names to be praised; 

-----

that at the name of Jesus Christ should every creature bend the knee, 
and every tongue confess Him Lord,
to God's own glory endlessly,
to God's own glory endlessly.
