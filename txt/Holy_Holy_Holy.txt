# Holy, Holy, Holy

Holy, Holy, Holy!
LORD God Almighty!
Early in the morning
our song shall rise to Thee;
Holy, Holy, Holy,
merciful and mighty!
God in three persons,
Blessed Trinity!

-----

Holy, Holy, Holy!
All the saints adore Thee,
casting down their golden crowns
around the glassy sea;
Cherubim and seraphim
falling down before Thee,
Who wert, and art,
and evermore shall be.

-----

Holy, Holy, Holy!
Though the darkness hide Thee,
though the eye of sinful man
Thy glory may not see;
Only Thou art holy,
there is none beside Thee
perfect in pow'r,
in love, and purity.

-----

Holy, Holy, Holy!
LORD God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise Thy name,
in earth and sky and sea
Holy, Holy, Holy
merciful and mighty!
God in three persons,
blessed Trinity!

> Reginald Heber
