# King Alfred's War Song

When the enemy comes in,
roaring like a flood,
coveting the Kingdom
and hungering for blood,
the Lord will raise a standard up
and lead his people on,
the Lord of Hosts will go before,
defeating every foe,
defeating every foe.

-----

For the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend us,
the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend. 

-----

For the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend us,
the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend. 

-----

Some men trust in chariots,
some trust in the horse,
but we will depend upon
the Name of Christ our Lord.
The Lord has made my hands to war,
and my fingers to fight,
the Lord lays low our enemies,
he raises us upright,
he raises us upright.

-----

For the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend us,
the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend. 

-----

For the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend us,
the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend. 

-----

A thousand fall on my left hand,
ten thousand to the right,
but Jesus will defend us from
the arrow in the night.
Protect us from the terrors of
the teeth of the devourer;
imbue us with your Spirit Lord,
encompass us with power,
encompass us with power.

-----

For the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend us,
the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend. 

-----

For the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend us,
the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend. 

-----

For the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend us,
the Lord is our defense,
Jesus defend.
