# Our God is Lifted Up 

Our God is lifted up
midst the shouts of joy.
Our God is lifted up
in the sounding of the trumpets.
Our God is lifted up
midst the shouts of joy.
Shout joyfully unto our God,
Shout joyfully unto our God

-----

Our God is lifted up
midst the shouts of joy.
Our God is lifted up
in the sounding of the trumpets.
Our God is lifted up
midst the shouts of joy.
Shout joyfully unto our God,
Shout joyfully unto our God

-----

Let the trumpets make a joyful noise.
Let us clap our hands
and praise our God.

-----

For our God is lifted up,
our God is lifted up,
our God is lifted up on high.
Our God is lifted up,
our God is lifted up,
our God is lifted up on high.
