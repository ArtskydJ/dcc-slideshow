# Psalm 110 

Jehovah to my Lord has said,
&Sit Thou at My right hand
Until I make Thy foes a stool
Where-on Thy feet may stand.& 

-----

Jehovah shall from Zion send
The scepter of Thy power.
In battle with Thine enemies
Be Thou the conqueror.

-----

A willing people in Thy day
Of power shall come to Thee.
Thy youth arrayed in holiness
Like morning dew shall be. 

-----

Jehovah swore, and from His oath
He never will depart:
&Of th'order of Melchizedek
A priest Thou ever art.&

-----

The Lord at Thy right hand shall smite
Earth's rulers in His wrath.
Among the nations He shall judge;
The slain shall fill His path.

> In many lands He'll overthrow. Their kings with ruin dread;. And, marching, He'll drink from the brook And so lift up His head.
