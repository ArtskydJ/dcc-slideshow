# I Will Rejoice (Habakkuk 3)

Though the trees shall not bloom
and the vine bears no fruit,
though the fields shall fail
and yield no food.
Though the flocks are cut off
from within the fold,
and though all is destroyed
both young and old.

-----

Yet I will rejoice in the Lord,
yes, I will be joyful in God, my Savior, 
I will rejoice in the Lord,
Yes, I will be joyful in God, my Savior, 
I will rejoice in the Lord,
I will rejoice in the Lord.

-----

Though the winds rise up
and the rivers roar,
though the thunder may crash
and storms destroy.
Though the mountains may fall
and the seas rush in,
and though nations invade
by the hands of evil men.

-----

Yet I will rejoice in the Lord,
yes, I will be joyful in God, my Savior, 
I will rejoice in the Lord,
Yes, I will be joyful in God, my Savior, 
I will rejoice in the Lord,
I will rejoice in the Lord.

-----

And the Sovereign Lord is all my strength, and He makes me to walk 
upon the high place.

-----

Yet I will rejoice in the Lord,
yes, I will be joyful in God, my Savior, 
I will rejoice in the Lord,
Yes, I will be joyful in God, my Savior, 
I will rejoice in the Lord,
I will rejoice in the Lord.
