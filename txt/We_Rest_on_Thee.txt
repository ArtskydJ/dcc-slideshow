# We Rest On Thee 

We rest on thee
our Shield and our Defender! 
We go not forth
alone against the foe; 
strong in thy strength,
safe in thy keeping tender,

-----

we rest on thee,
and in thy name we go. 
Strong in thy strength,
safe in thy keeping tender, 
we rest on thee,
and in thy name we go.

-----

Yes, in thy name,
O Captain of salvation! 
In thy dear name,
all other names above, 
Jesus our Righ-
teousness, our sure Foundation,

-----

our Prince of glory
and our King of love. 
Jesus our Righ-
teousness, our sure Foundation, 
our Prince of glory
and our King of love. 

-----

We go in faith,
our own great weakness feeling, 
and needing more
each day thy grace to know: 
yet from our hearts
a song of triumph pealing;

-----

we rest on thee,
and in thy name we go. 
Yet from our hearts
a song of triumph pealing; 
we rest on thee,
and in thy name we go.

-----

We rest on thee,
our Shield and our Defender! 
Thine is the battle,
thine shall be the praise; 
when passing through
the gates of pearly splendor,

-----

victors, we rest
with thee, through endless days. 
When passing through
the gates of pearly splendor, 
victors, we rest
with thee, through endless days.
