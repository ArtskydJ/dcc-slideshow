# The God of Abraham Praise 

The God of Abraham praise,
who reigns enthroned above; 
Ancient of everlasting days,
and God of Love;
Jehovah, great I AM!
by earth and Heav'n confessed;
I bow and bless the sacred Name
forever blest.

-----

The God of Abraham praise,
at Whose supreme command
From earth I riseâ€”and seek the joys
at His right hand;
I all on earth forsake,
its wisdom, fame, and pow'r;
And Him my only portion make,
my shield and tow'r.

-----

He by Himself has sworn;
I on His oath depend,
I shall, on eagle wings upborne,
to Heav'n ascend.
I shall behold His face;
I shall His power adore,
And sing the wonders of His grace forevermore.

-----

The whole triumphant host
give thanks to God on high;
&Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,&
they ever cry.
Hail, Abraham's God, and mine!
I join the heav'nly lays;
All might and majesty are Thine,
and endless praise.
