# It Came Upon The Midnight Clear

It came upon the midnight clear,
that glorious song of old,
from angels bending near the earth,
to touch their harps of gold;

-----

"Peace on the earth, good will to men
from heav'n's all gracious King!"
The world in solemn stillness lay
to hear the angels sing.

-----

To us a child of hope is born,
to us a son is giv'n,
him shall the tribes of earth obey,
him all the hosts of heav'n. 

-----

His name shall be the Prince of Peace,
forevermore adored,
the Wonderful, the Counselor,
the Mighty Lord of heav'n.

-----

His power increasing still shall spread,
his reign no end shall know;
justice shall guard his throne above,
and peace abound below. 

-----

He comes the prisoners to release,
in Satan's bondage held;
the gates of brass before him burst,
the iron fetters yield.

-----

He comes the broken heart to bind,
the wounded soul to cure,
and with the treasures of his grace
to 'nrich the humbled poor. 

-----

Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
your welcome shall proclaim;
and heav'n's eternal arches ring
with your beloved name.
