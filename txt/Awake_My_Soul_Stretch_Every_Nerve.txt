# Awake, My Soul, Stretch Every Nerve 

Awake, my soul, stretch ev'ry nerve,
and press with vigor on;
A heav'nly race demands thy zeal,
and an immortal crown
A cloud of witnesses around
hold thee in full survey;
Forget the steps already trod,
and onward urge thy way.

# Awake, My Soul, Stretch Every Nerve

'Tis God's all-animating voice
that calls thee from on high;
'Tis His own hand presents the prize
to thine aspiring eye.
That prize with peerless glories bright,
which shall new lustre boast,
When victors' wreaths and monarch's gems shall blend in common dust.

-----

Blest Saviour, introduced by Thee,
have I my race begun;
And, crowned with vict'ry,
at Thy feet I'll lay my honors down.
