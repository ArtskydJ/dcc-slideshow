# I Know That My Redeemer Lives

I know that my Redeemer lives.
What joy this blest assurance gives!
He lives, he lives, who once was dead;
he lives, my everlasting head!

-----

He lives, to bless me with his love,
he lives to plead for me above;
he lives, my hungry soul to feed;
he lives to help in time of need.

-----

He lives, and grants me daily breath;
he lives, and I shall conquer death;
he lives, my future to prepare;
he lives to bring me safely there.

-----

He lives, all glory to his name;
he lives, my savior, still the same;
what joy this blest assurance gives;
I know that my redeemer lives!
