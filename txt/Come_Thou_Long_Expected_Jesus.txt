# Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus 

Come, thou long expected Jesus,
born to set thy people free;
From our fears and sins release us;
let us find our rest in thee.

-----

Israel's strength and consolation,
hope of all the earth thou art,
dear Desire of ev'ry nation,
Joy of ev'ry longing heart.

-----

Born thy people to deliver,
born a child and yet a king,
born to reign in us forever,
now thy gracious kingdom bring.

-----

By thine own eternal Spirit
rule in all our hearts alone;
by thine all sufficient merit,
raise us to thy glorious throne.

-----

Finish then thy new creation
pure and spotless let us be.
Let us see thy great salvation
perfectly restored in thee;

-----

Changed from glory into glory
'til in heaven we take our place,
'til we cast our crowns before thee
lost in wonder, love and praise,
lost in wonder, love and praise.
