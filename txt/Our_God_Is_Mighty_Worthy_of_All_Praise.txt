# Our God Is Mighty, Worthy of All Praise

Our God is mighty, worthy of praising;
sing unto Him a glad, triumphant song;
He is the sovereign in earth and heaven;
to Him all strength and majesty belong.

-----

Declare His glory among the nations;
through all creation His triumph we sing,
till all earth's peoples in adoration bow
and Jesus Christ be everlasting King.

-----

Our God is gracious, infinite mercy;
He bridged the hopeless gulf our sin had made;
He gave his own son for our salvation
in Jesus Christ we meet God unafraid! 

-----

Declare His glory among the nations;
through all creation His triumph we sing,
till all earth's peoples in adoration bow
and Jesus Christ be everlasting King.

-----

Our God is faithful, He will work in us;
fulfilling all the purpose He has planned,
cleansing our hearts and giving His Spirit,
making us strong to keep His last command.

-----

Declare His glory among the nations;
through all creation His triumph we sing,
till all earth's peoples in adoration bow
and Jesus Christ be everlasting King.

-----

Our God is sovereign over creation,
one day His earth shall hear His mighty voice:
with shout of joy Christ shall come in splendor
lift up your hearts, confess Him, and rejoice!
