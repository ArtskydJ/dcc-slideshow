# Around You Such Beauty

Around you such beauty,
Your majesty could fill an endless sky;
holy are You Lord. 
Transcendent, exalted,
the heavens can not contain Your presence.
Holy are you, Lord.

-----

And as I behold Your glory I'm undone.
I bow down at Your feet, 
I bow down at Your feet,
I bow down at Your feet, 
for You are my God, my God.

-----

You saved me, the sinner,
with crimson red,
You washed me white as snow;
how I love You Lord. 
You loved me the mocker,
with kindness You won my heart forever.
How I love You Lord. 

-----

And as I behold Your glory I'm undone.
I bow down at Your feet, 
I bow down at Your feet,
I bow down at Your feet, 
for You are my God, my God.

-----

I bow down at Your feet, 
I bow down at Your feet, 
I bow down at Your feet, 
for You are my God, my God.

# Take Me In

So take me in to the Holy of Holies,
take me in by the blood of the Lamb.
So take me in to the Holy of Holies,
take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am.

-----

Take me past the outer courts,
and to the holy place,
past the brazen alter;
Lord, I want to see Your face.

-----

Pass me by the crowds of people,
and the priests who sing their praise;
I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness but it's only found in one place.

-----

So take me in to the Holy of Holies,
take me in by the blood of the Lamb.
So take me in to the Holy of Holies,
take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am.

-----

So take me in to the Holy of Holies,
take me in by the blood of the Lamb.
So take me in to the Holy of Holies,
take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am.
Take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am.
Take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am.

# Come and Rejoice

Come and rejoice,
O holy nation,
come and sing praises to Him. 
Come and bow down;
worship before Him,
Jesus the King of all kings,
Jesus the King of all kings. 

-----

With the sound of the trumpet
He summons the nations, 
calling a priesthood to go in His name,
to show forth His power to this generation,
to worship before Him,
a kingdom of praise. 

-----

Come and rejoice,
O holy nation,
come and sing praises to Him. 
Come and bow down;
worship before Him, 
Jesus the King of all kings,
Jesus the King of all kings. 

-----

Come and rejoice,
O holy nation,
come and sing praises to Him. 
Come and bow down;
worship before him, 
Jesus the King of all kings,
Jesus the King of all kings.
Jesus, the King of all kings.
