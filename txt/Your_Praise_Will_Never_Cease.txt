# Your Praise Will Never Cease

And when we've sung Your praise
for a thousand years
we'll have just begun to sing.
For Your throne will reign through eternity
and Your praise will never cease,
it will never cease.

There's an ancient song that's sung anew
by the ones who live to worship You;
like a river it runs through ev'ry age,
driven by the glory of Your grace.

-----

And when we've sung Your praise
for a thousand years
we'll have just begun to sing.
For Your throne will reign through eternity
and Your praise will never cease,
it will never cease.

-----

To the One who caused all things to be,
to the One who rules in sov'reignty,
we declare our joy in You, our King,
and delight in being Your redeemed.

-----

And when we've sung Your praise
for a thousand years
we'll have just begun to sing.
For Your throne will reign through eternity
and Your praise will never cease,
it will never cease.

And when we've sung Your praise
for a thousand years
we'll have just begun to sing.
For Your throne will reign through eternity
and Your praise will never cease,
it will never cease.
