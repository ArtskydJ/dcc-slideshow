# Most Holy Judge 

Most Holy Judge
I stood before you guilty
when you sent Jesus to the cross
for my sin.

-----

There your love was revealed,
your justice vindicated.
One sacrifice has paid the cost,
for all who trust in Jesus.

-----

# Most Holy Judge

Now I'm justified
you declare me righteous;
justified by the blood of the Lamb.
Justified freely by your mercy,
by faith I stand and I'm justified.

-----

# Most Holy Judge 

I come to you
and I can call you father.
There is no fear there is no shame
before you.

-----

For by your gift of grace,
now I am one of your children;
an heir with those who bear your name
and share the hope of glory.

-----

# Most Holy Judge

Now I'm justified
you declare me righteous;
justified by the blood of the Lamb.
Justified freely by your mercy,
by faith I stand and I'm justified.

-----

# Most Holy Judge 

Now I'm justified
you declare me righteous;
justified by the blood of the Lamb.
Justified freely by your mercy,
by faith I stand and I'm justified.
