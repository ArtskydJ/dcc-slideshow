# Psalm 58

You may be gods, but can you claim
that you speak righteousness? 
And do you judge the sons of men
in truth and uprightness? 
No, even in your very heart
you wickedness produce; 
on earth you weigh out with your hands
your violent abuse.

-----

The wicked from their day of birth
are strangers to the way; 
they from the womb come speaking lies;
they wander far astray. 
They have the venom of a snake;
they have an adder's ear 
which they have closed to charmers' song;
skilled charmers they'll not hear.

-----

O God, inside their opened mouths
break off their cruel teeth; 
the fangs of these young lions, Lord,
tear out by roots beneath. 
Let them like runoff waters be
that leave the ground soon dry. 
Let arrows that he aims become
like headless shafts that fly.

-----

Let them be like the snails that melt
along the course they run; 
or like one prematurely born
who never sees the sun. 
They are like blazing thorns which you
beneath your kettles lay, 
whose heat is scarcely felt before
a wind sweeps them away.

-----

The just rejoices when he sees
that vengeance is complete, 
for in the blood of wicked men
he then will wash his feet. 
They'll say, "There surely is reward
for righteous ones of worth; 
there surely is a living God
who judges in the earth."
