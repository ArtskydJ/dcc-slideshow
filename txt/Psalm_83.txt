# Psalm 83

Do not be silent God, or unresponding!
Do not remain at rest, O Mighty One!
For now Your foes arouse and make a clamor; 
Your bitter enemies lift up the head.
Against Your People now they plot in secret;
They meet to work against Your hidden ones.
They say, "Let us go up and end their nation.
The name of Israel shall be no more!"

-----

Together they conspire in deadly earnest;
Against You they have made a covenant.
The Ishmaelites are there, the tents of Edom,
The men of Moab with the Hagarenes.
See Gebal, Amalek, with men of Ammon;
Behold Philistia and them of Tyre.
For Ashur too has come and joins their forces;
They are the power of the sons of Lot.

-----

Treat them like Midian, like Jabin's army.
Treat them like Sisera at Kishon's brook.
At Endor they were all annihilated.
And they became as dung upon the ground. 
Like Oreb make their chiefs, their lords like Zebah!
Who thought they would possess the land of God.
My God, O make them be like whirling dust-clouds;
Make them like bits of chaff before the wind.

# Like fire that burns the woods, like flames of lightning,
Pursue them with Your storms and strike with fear.
Fill up their faces with humiliation,
And let them seek Your name, Jehovah, then. 
Let them be terrified and shamed forever,
And let them be dismayed and be destroyed.
Let them know You alone, You are Jehovah.
You are the One Most High o'er all the earth.

Like fire that burns the woods, like flames of lightning,
Pursue them with Your storms and strike with fear.
Fill up their faces with humiliation,
And let them seek Your name, Jehovah, then. 
Let them be terrified and shamed forever,
And let them be dismayed and be destroyed.
Let them know You alone, You are Jehovah.
You are the One Most High o'er all the earth.
