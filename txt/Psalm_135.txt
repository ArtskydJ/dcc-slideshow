# Psalm 135

Hallelujah praise the Lord's name!
Praise him servants of the Lord,
you that in the Lord's house serve him,
in God's courtyard standing guard.

-----

Praise the Lord!
How good the Lord is! 
Sing his name, how sweet its tone!
For the Lord has chosen Jacob,
Israel to be his own.

-----

Well I know how great the Lord is;
our Lord is above all gods.
For the Lord does what he pleases
in all heav'n, earth, deeps, and floods.

-----

He it is who lifts the vapors
from the ends of earth and sea,
who with lightnings brings the rain down,
from his store the wind sets free.

-----

Who slew all of Egypt's first born,
on you, Egypt, wonders sent,
signs to Pharaoh and his servants,
who killed kings, their kingdoms rent,
