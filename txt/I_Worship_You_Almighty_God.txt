# I Worship You, Almighty God

I worship you, Almighty God,
there is none like you.
I worship you, O Prince of Peace,
that is what I long to do.

-----

I give you praise
for you are my righteousness.
I worship you, Almighty God,
there is none like you.

-----

O God, to You we praise, confess
There is none like you.
With angels now we cry aloud:,
Yours the glory, majesty!.

-----

We give you praise
and adore Your holy name. 
We worship you, Almighty God,
there is none like you.
There is none like you. 
There is no one like you.
