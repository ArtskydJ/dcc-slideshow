# My Dear Redeemer and My Lord

My dear Redeemer and my Lord,
I read my duty in Thy Word;
But in your life the law appears,
Drawn out in living characters.

-----

Such was your truth, and such your zeal,
Such deference to your Father's will,
Such love and meekness so divine,
I would transcribe and make them mine.

-----

Be now my Pattern; make me bear
More of your gracious image here;
Then God the Judge shall own my name
Amongst the followers of the Lamb.
