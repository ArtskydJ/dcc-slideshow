# Come, Thou Fount

Come, Thou fount of ev'ry blessing,
tune my heart to sing Thy grace; 
streams of mercy, never ceasing,
call for songs of loudest praise. 
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
sung by flaming tongues above; 
Praise His name I'm fixed upon it,
name of God's redeeming love. 

-----

Here I am by Thy good blessing;
Thou hast brought me to this place; 
and I know Thy hand will bring me
safely home by Thy good grace. 
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
wand'ring from the fold of God; 
He, to rescue me from danger,
interposed his precious blood.

-----

O to grace how great a debtor
daily I'm constrained to be! 
Let that grace now, like a fetter,
bind my wand'ring heart to Thee: 
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
prone to leave the God I love; 
Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
seal it for Thy courts above. 
Seal it for Thy courts above.
