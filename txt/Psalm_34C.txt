# Psalm 34C

O sons and daughters come give ear and learn from me the LORD to fear 
who seeking good long life desires?
Or who to many days aspires? 
From evil make your tongue refrain from speaking lies your lips restrain 
from every wicked way depart do good
seek peace with all your heart

-----

The LORD on just men keeps His eyes
His ears are open to their cries the LORD
on vile men turns His face from each
their memory to erase the righteous 
cried the LORD gave heed and then from all their troubles freed to broken hearts the
LORD is near to save the contrite
He'll appear.

-----

Though righteous men great troubles see the LORD from all will set them free and all 
his bones He'll keep secure no broken ones will he endure but evil slays all wicked men
those hating just men are condemned
the LORD redeems those serving Him 
none trusting Him will He condemn.

> William B. Bradbury, 1859 SWEET HOUR LMD
