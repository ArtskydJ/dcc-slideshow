# O the Mercy of God

Oh the mercy of God,
The glory of grace;
That You chose to redeem us
To forgive and restore;
And You call us Your children
Chosen in Him
To be holy and blameless
To the glory of God.

-----

To the praise of His glorious grace;
To the praise of His glory and power.
To Him be all glory, Honor, and praise
Forever and ever and ever, Amen.

-----

Oh the richness of grace,
The depths of His love.
In Him is redemption,
The forgiveness of sin.
You called us as righteous,
Predestined in Him.
For the praise of His glory
Included in Christ.

-----

To the praise of His glorious grace;
To the praise of His glory and power.
To Him be all glory, Honor, and praise
Forever and ever and ever, Amen.

-----

Oh, the glory of God
Expressed in His Son.
His image and likeness
Revealed to us all.
The plea of the ages
Completed in Christ
That we be presented,
Perfected in Him.

-----

To the praise of His glorious grace;
To the praise of His glory and power.
To Him be all glory, Honor, and praise
Forever and ever and ever, Amen.
