# Psalm 139.7-14

Where could I go from Your Spirit?
How could I hide from Your eyes?
Why would I wander away from You,
knowing that You are so wise?

-----

If I take the wings of the morning, 
And dwell in the depths of the sea,
Even the darkness hides nothing from You, 
and with Your hand You will lead me.

-----

For You did knit me together
even before I was born.
I will confess You and praise You,
You are my wonderful.
