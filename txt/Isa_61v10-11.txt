# Isaiah 61:10-11

I will exalt the Lord with joy,
yes my soul shall be joyful in my God;
for he has armed me with his robe of victory
and with righteousness he has covered me, 

-----

as a groom adorns his head like a priest
and a bride is adorned with jewels
as the bud in the spring comes forth
gardens too rising from the earth.
