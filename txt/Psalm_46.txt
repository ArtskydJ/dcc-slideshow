# Psalm 46

God is our refuge and our strength,
in straits a present aid;
and, therefore, tho' the earth remove
we will not be afraid; 
tho' hills amidst the seas be cast,
tho' troubled waters roar.
Yea, tho' the swelling billows shake
the mountains on the shore. 

-----

A river is whose streams make glad
the City of our God;
the holy place where in the Lord
Most High has His abode. 
Yea, God is in the midst of her;
unmoved she stands for aye;
and God will surely grant her help
before the break of day.

-----

The nations raged: the kingdoms moved;
and when the earth had heard
the mighty voice he sent abroad
it melted at His word.
The LORD of hosts is on our side
our safety to secure;
the God of Jacob is for us
a refuge strong and sure.

-----

O come, behold what wondrous works
have by the LORD been wrought;
come, see what desolations great
He on the earth has brought. 
To utmost ends of all the earth
wars into peace He turns;
the bow He breaks, the spear He cuts,
in fire the chariot burns. 

-----

Be still and know that I am God;
among the nations I
will be exalted; I on earth
will be exalted high. 
The LORD of hosts is on our side
our safety to secure;
the God of Jacob is for us
a refuge strong and sure.
