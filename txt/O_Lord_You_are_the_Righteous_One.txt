# Psalm 119S

O Lord, You are the righteous One;
Just judgments come from You. 
Your testimonies You command
in righteousness and truth.

-----

My zeal consume me utterly;
Your words my foes have shunned.
Because Your words are very pure,
Your servant loves each one.

-----

Though I am lowly and despised,
Your laws I'll not forget. 
Eternal is Your righteousness;
In Your law truth is set.

-----

Though grief and trouble come to me,
Your law is my delight. 
Your laws forever righteous are;
Through wisdom give me life.
