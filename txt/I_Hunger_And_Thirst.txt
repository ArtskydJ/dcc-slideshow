# I Hunger and I Thirst 

I hunger and I thirst;
Jesus, my manna be;
ye living waters,
burst out of the rock for me.

-----

Thou bruised and broken Bread,
my lifelong needs supply;
as living souls are fed,
O feed me, or I die

-----

Thou true life giving vine,
let me thy sweetness prove;
renew my life with thine,
refresh my soul with love.
