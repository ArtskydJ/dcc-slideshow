# Psalm 149A

Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!
Sing the Lord a new song!
Sing with fresh thanksgiving
where saints gather as one.

-----

May the thought of his Maker
joy to Israel bring.
Let the sons of Zion
take delight in their king.

-----

In exuberant dancing
let them worship His name;
tambourine and harp join
help them sing of His fame.

-----

For the Lord, in His people,
finds great joy and delight;
He adorns the humble,
saving them by His might.

> Psalm 149.
