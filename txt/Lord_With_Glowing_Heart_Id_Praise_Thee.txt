# Lord With Glowing Heart I'd Praise Thee

Lord, with glowing heart I'd praise thee for the bliss thy love bestows, 
for the pard'ning grace that saves me, and the peace that from it flows, 
help O GOD, my weak endeavor; this dull soul to rapture raise: 
Thou must light the flame or never can my love be warmed to praise.

-----

Praise my soul, the God that sought thee, wretched wand'rer far astray; 
found thee lost, and kindly brought thee from the paths of death away. 
Praise with love's devoutest feeling, him who saw thy guiltborn fear, 
and the light of hope revealing, bade the bloodstained cross appear.

-----

Praise thy Savior God that drew thee to that cross new life to give, 
held a bloodsealed pardon to thee, bade thee look to him and live. 
Praise the grace whose threats alarmed thee roused thee from thy fatal ease; 
praise the grace whose promise warmed thee, 
praise the grace that whispered peace.

-----

Lord this bosom's ardent feeling vainly would my lips express: 
low before thy footstool kneeling, design thy suppliant's pray'r to bless. 
Let thy love, my soul's chief treasure, love's pure flame within me raise; 
and since words can never measure, 
let my life show forth thy praise.
