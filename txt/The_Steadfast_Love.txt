# The Steadfast Love

The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
His mercies never come to an end.
They are new every morning,
new every morning.
Great is thy faithfulness, O Lord.
Great is thy faithfulness.

-----

The Lord's my portion, my hope, my salvation.
A mighty stronghold in times of distress.
You take all of our sadness,
fill us with gladness. 
Great is thy faithfulness, O Lord.
Great is thy faithfulness.

-----

O sovereign Lord, O great ruler of nations,
advance your kingdom,
subdue all your foes.
Revive now your people,
strengthen the feeble. 
Great is thy faithfulness, O Lord.
Great is thy faithfulness.
