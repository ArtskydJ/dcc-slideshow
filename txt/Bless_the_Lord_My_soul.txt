# Bless The Lord, My Soul (from Psalm 103)

Bless the Lord, my soul,
and bless God's holy name. 
Bless the Lord, my soul,
Who leads me into life. 

-----

It is God who forgives all your guilt,
Who heals every one of your ills, 
Who redeems your life from the grave,
Who crowns you with love and compassion. 

-----

Bless the Lord, my soul,
and bless God's holy name. 
Bless the Lord, my soul,
Who leads me into life. 

-----

The Lord is compassion and love,
the Lord is patient and rich in mercy. 
God does not treat us according to our sins,
nor repay us according to our faults. 

-----

Bless the Lord, my soul,
and bless God's holy name. 
Bless the Lord, my soul,
Who leads me into life. 

-----

As a father has compassion on his children,
the Lord has mercy on those who revere Him; 
for God knows of what we are made,
and remembers that we are dust.

-----

Bless the Lord, my soul,
and bless God's holy name. 
Bless the Lord, my soul,
Who leads me into life.
Who leads me into life.
Who leads me into life.
