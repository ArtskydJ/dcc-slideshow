# Psalm 36

Thy Mercy Lord, extends to heaven; 
thy faithfulness, the sky.
Thy Justice is like mounts of God; 
thy Judgments depths defy.
LORD, thou preservest man and beast. 
How precious, God, thy grace!
Beneath the shadow of thy wings 
men's sons their trust shall place.

-----

They with the bounty of thy house 
shall be well satisfied;
From rivers full of thy delights 
thou dost their drink provide.
Because the fountain filled with life 
is only found with thee;
And in that purest light of thine 
we clearly light shall see.

-----

# To them that know thee, evermore 
thy loving kindnesses show,
And still on men of upright heart 
thy righteousness bestow.
Let not the foot of pride crush me, 
nor wicked hand detain.
There evil doers fall; thrust down, 
they cannot rise again.

To them that know thee, evermore 
thy loving kindnesses show,
And still on men of upright heart 
thy righteousness bestow.
Let not the foot of pride crush me, 
nor wicked hand detain.
There evil doers fall; thrust down, 
they cannot rise again.
