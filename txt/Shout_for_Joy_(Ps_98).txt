# Psalm 98 (Shout For Joy)

Oh, sing to the LORD a new song,
marvelous things He has done before us. 
His right hand and His holy arm
have gained Him the victory. 

-----

For the LORD has made His salvation known,
and His righteousness to the nations shown
and remembered mercy and truth to Israel's house. 

-----

Women: Let the rivers clap as they roll along,
let the mountains burst into joyful song,
let the people shout as they celebrate and praise.
Men: Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna to the Lord.

-----

ALL: Shout for joy to the LORD all the earth,
burst into jubilant song together; 
make music to the LORD all the earth,
let creation respond with singing.

-----

ALL: Let the sea resound, let the world rejoice,
let the trumpet blast with a mighty voice, 
let the people dance as they celebrate and praise.

-----

Women: Let the rivers clap as they roll along,
let the mountains burst into joyful song,
let the people shout as they celebrate and praise.
Men: Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna to the LORD.

-----

ALL: For the LORD is coming to judge the earth.
and with righteousness He shall judge the world, 
and the peoples He shall judge with equity.
