# Amazing Grace / My Chains Are Gone 

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now am found
was blind, but now I see.

-----

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
the hour I first believed.

-----

My chains are gone, I've been set free,
my God, my Savior has ransomed me;
and like a flood His mercy reigns,
unending love, amazing grace.

-----

The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be
as long as life endures.

-----

My chains are gone, I've been set free,
my God, my Savior has ransomed me;
and like a flood His mercy reigns,
unending love, amazing grace.

-----

My chains are gone, I've been set free,
my God, my Savior has ransomed me;
and like a flood His mercy reigns,
unending love, amazing grace.

-----

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
the sun forbear to shine;
But God, Who called me here below
will be forever mine,
will be forever mine,
You are forever mine.
