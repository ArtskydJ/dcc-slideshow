# Worship the King

Worship the King,
the One who died to free us
the One who conquered death in victory. 
Worship the King,
the One who lives forever,
He shall reign throughout eternity.

-----

Darkness and gloom filled the earth,
Satan was celebrating victory. 
Jesus arose.
He is alive,
no grave could hold the King of kings
and the Lord of lords.

Worship the King,
the One who died to free us
the One who conquered death in victory. 
Worship the King,
the One who lives forever,
He shall reign throughout eternity.

-----

Then ev'ry tongue shall confess,
"He is the Christ, yes, He is the Lord." 
Jesus arose.
He is alive,
no grave could hold the King of kings
and the Lord of lords.

-----

Worship the King,
the One who died to free us
the One who conquered death in victory. 
Worship the King,
the One who lives forever,
He shall reign throughout eternity.

-----

Worship the King,
the One who died to free us
the One who conquered death in victory. 
Worship the King,
the One who lives forever,
He shall reign throughout eternity.
He shall reign throughout eternity,
He shall reign throughout eternity.
