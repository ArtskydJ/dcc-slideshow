# Love Crucified Arose

Long ago he blessed the earth,
born older than the years. 
And in the stall a cross he saw,
through the first of many tears.
A life of homeless wandering
cast out in sorrow's way. 
The Shepherd seeking for the lost
his life the price he'd pay.

-----

Love crucified arose,
the risen One in splendor,
Jehovah's sole Defender
has won the victory.
Love crucified arose
and the grave became a place of hope
for the heart that sin and sorrow broke
is beating once again.

-----

Throughout your life you felt the weight
of what you'd come to give;
to drink for us that crimson cup
so we might really live.
At last the time to love and die
the dark appointed day,
that one forsaken moment when
your Father turned his face away.

-----

Love crucified arose,
the One who lived and died for me
was Satan's nail-pierced casualty
now he's breathing once again.
Love crucified arose
and the grave became a place of hope
for the heart that sin and sorrow broke
is beating once again.

-----

Love crucified arose,
the risen One in splendor,
Jehovah's sole Defender
has won the victory.
Love crucified arose
and the grave became a place of hope
for the heart that sin and sorrow broke
is beating once again.
