# Immanuel 

A sign shall be given,
a virgin will conceive,
a human baby bearing undiminished Deity;
the glory of the nations,
a light for all to see,
and hope for all who will embrace
his warm reality. 

-----

Immanuel,
our God is with us,
and if God is with us,
who could stand against us? 
Our God is with us, Immanuel!

-----

For all those who dwell
in the shadow of death,
a glorious light has dawned. 
For all those who stumble
in the darkness,
behold! Your Light has come!

# Immanuel

Immanuel,
our God is with us,
and if God is with us,
who could stand against us? 
Our God is with us, Immanuel!

-----

So what will be your answer?
O, will you hear the call
of him who did not spare his Son
But gave him for us all? 
On earth there is no power,
there is no depth or height,
to ever separate us
from the Love of God in Christ. 

-----

Immanuel,
our God is with us,
and if God is with us,
who could stand against us? 
Our God is with us, Immanuel!
Our God is with us, Immanuel!
