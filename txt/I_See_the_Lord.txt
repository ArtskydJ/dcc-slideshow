# I See the Lord

I see the Lord, seated on the throne, exalted; and the train of His robe
fills the temple with glory. 
And the whole earth is filled,
and the whole earth is filled,
and the whole earth is filled with His glory. 

-----

Holy, holy,
holy, holy—holy is the LORD. 
Holy, holy,
holy, holy—holy is the LORD.
