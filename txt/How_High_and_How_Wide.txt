# How High and How Wide 

No eye has seen
and no ear has heard
and no mind has ever conceived
the glorious things
that You have prepared
for ev'ryone who has believed.

-----

You brought us near
and You called us Your own;
and made us joint heirs with Your Son.

-----

How high and how wide,
how deep and how long,
how sweet and how strong is Your love! 
How lavish Your grace,
how faithful Your ways,
how great is Your love, O Lord!

-----

Objects of mercy
who should have known wrath
we're filled with unspeakable joy; 
riches of wisdom,
unsearchable wealth,
and the wonder of knowing Your voice. 

-----

You are our treasure
and our great reward
our hope and our glorious King.

-----

How high and how wide,
how deep and how long,
how sweet and how strong is Your love! 
How lavish Your grace,
how faithful Your ways,
how great is Your love, O Lord!

-----

How high and how wide,
how deep and how long,
how sweet and how strong is Your love. 
How lavish Your grace,
how faithful Your ways,
how great is Your love, O Lord.
