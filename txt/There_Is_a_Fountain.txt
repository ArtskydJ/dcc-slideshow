# There Is a Fountain

There is a fountain filled with blood, drawn
from Immanuel's veins;
and sinners, sprinkled by the blood,
lose all their guilty stains; 
lose all their guilty stains,
lose all their guilty stains; 
and sinners, sprinkled by the blood, lose all their guilty stains.

-----

The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day; 
and their have I, as vile as he, washed all my sins away; 
washed all my sins away, washed all my sins away; 
and there have I, as vile as he washed all my sins away.

-----

Dear dying Lamb, your precious blood shall never lose its pow'r, 
till all the ransomed church of God be saved to sin no more; 
be saved to sin no more, be saved to sin no more; 
till all the ransomed church of God be saved to sin no more.
