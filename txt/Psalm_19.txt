# Psalm 19

The spacious heav'ns declare
the glory of our God; 
the firmament displays his handiwork abroad; day unto day doth utter speech
and night to night doth knowledge teach.

-----

Aloud they do not speak;
they utter forth no word,
nor into language break;
their voice is never heard,
yet through the world their line extends,
their words to earth's remotest ends.

-----

In heav'n he sent a tent,
a dwelling for the sun,
which as a mighty man
delights his course to run.
He bridegroom-like in his array,
comes from his chamber, bringing day.

-----

His daily going forth is from the end of heav'n:
the firmament to him is for his circuit giv'n;
and everywhere from end to end,
his radiant heat doth extend.
