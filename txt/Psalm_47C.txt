All nations, clap your hands
and unto God in triumph shout! 
How awesome is the Lord most high,
great King the earth throughout! 
Beneath our feet He has subdued
the nations all about! 

-----

Praises sing! Sing your praises unto God!
Sing his praise!
Lift your voices and
sing praises to our King!

-----

He chose us our inheritance
our homeland there is found 
He gave us this in Jacob, unto
whom His love abounds. 
God has ascended in the midst
of shouts and joyful sounds!

-----

Praises sing! Sing your praises unto God!
Sing his praise!
Lift your voices and
sing praises to our King!

-----

The Lord ascended while the trumpets
rang with happy tone, 
for God is King of all the earth;
sing praise to Him alone. 
God rules the nations;
God is seated on His holy throne.

-----

Praises sing! Sing your praises unto God!
Sing his praise!
Lift your voices and
sing praises to our King!

-----

The princes and the nobles of
the nations now draw nigh; 
as people of the God of Abraham,
they unify; 
for this world's shields belong to God,
He is exalted high!

-----

Praises sing! Sing your praises unto God!
Sing his praise!
Lift your voices and
sing praises to our King!
