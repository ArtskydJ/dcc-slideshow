# Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence

Let all mortal flesh keep silence,
 And with fear and trembling stand;
Set your minds on things eternal,
 For with blessing in His hand,
Christ our Lord to earth descended,
 Came our homage to command.

-----

King of kings, yet born of Mary,
 once upon the earth He stood;
Lord of lords we now perceive Him,
 In the body and the blood;
He has given to all the faithful
 His own self for heavenly food.

-----

Rank on rank the host of heaven
 Stream before Him on the way,
As the Light of light descending
 From the realms of endless day,
Comes the powers of hell to vanish
 Clears the gloom of hell away.

-----

At His feet the six-winged seraph,
 Cherubim with sleepless eye,
Veil their faces to His presence,
 As with ceaseless voice they cry,
"Alleluia, Alleluia
Alleluia, Lord Most High!"
