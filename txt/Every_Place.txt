# Every Place 

Ev'ry place, ev'ry place
where our feet shall tread, 
ev'ry tribe, ev'ry race
God has given us.

-----

As we see the world in tatters,
as we watch their dreams break down, 
we can hear their quiet anguish:
&come and help us!&

-----

Brought to life by God's own Spirit,
joined together in His Son, 
now the church with strength arises
like an army.

-----

Ev'ry place, ev'ry place
where our feet shall tread, 
ev'ry tribe, ev'ry race
God has given us.

-----

In the midst of boastful darkness
shines a Light that cannot fail, 
and the blind behold His glory,
Jesus! Jesus!

-----

Not content with restoration
of the remnant in the land, 
He has filled us with His power
 for the nations.
