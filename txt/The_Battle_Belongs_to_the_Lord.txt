# The Battle Belongs to the Lord

In heavenly armor we'll enter the land,
the battle belongs to the Lord. 
No weapon that's fashioned
against us will stand,
the battle belongs to the Lord. 

-----

And we sing glory, honor,
power and strength to the Lord. 
We sing glory, honor,
power and strength to the Lord.

-----

When the power of darkness
comes in like a flood,
the battle belongs to the Lord. 
He'll raise up a standard,
the power of His blood,
the battle belongs to the Lord.
