# How Lovely is Your dwelling Place (Psalm 84)

How lovely is Your dwelling place,
Almighty Lord;
There's a hunger deep inside my soul.
Only in Your presence
are my heart and flesh restored,
How lovely is our dwelling place.

-----

In Your courts there's shelter for the greatest and the small,
the sparrow has a place to build her nest.
The pilgrim finds refreshment in the rains that fall,
and each one has the strength to meet the test.

-----

How lovely is Your dwelling place,
Almighty Lord;
There's a hunger deep inside my soul.
Only in Your presence
are my heart and flesh restored,
How lovely is our dwelling place.
