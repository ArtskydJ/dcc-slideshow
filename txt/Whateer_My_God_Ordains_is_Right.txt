# Whate'er My God Ordains is Right

Whate'er my God ordains is right: His holy will abideth.
I will be still whate'er He doth, and follow where He guideth.
He is my God; though dark my road, He holds me that I shall not fall
wherefore to Him I leave it all.

-----

Whate'er my God ordains is right: He never will deceive me; He leads me by the proper path; I know He will not leave me. I take, content, what He hath sent; His hand can turn my griefs away, and patiently I wait His day.

-----

Whate'er my God ordains is right: though now this cup, in drinking, may bitter seem to my faint heart, I take it, all unshrinking.
My God is true; each morn anew sweet comfort yet shall fill my heart, and pain and sorrow shall depart.

-----

Whate'er my God ordains is right: here shall my stand be taken; though sorrow, need, or death be mine, yet am I not forsaken.
My Father's care is round me there; He holds me that I shall not fall; and so to Him I leave it all.
