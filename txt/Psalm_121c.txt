# Psalm 121

Unto the hills I lift my longing eyes.
Whence comes my aid?
My help is from the LORD, the One who heav'n
and earth has made.
Your foot from stumbling he will ever keep;
he who preserves your life will never sleep.

-----

He who keeps Israel slumbers not nor sleeps,
by night or day. 
The LORD keeps you; a shade on your right hand,
the LORD will stay.
Throughout the day the sun shall never smite;
no moon shall harm you in the hours of night.

-----

The LORD himself will your protector be,
from every ill. 
From every evil he will keep your soul
securely still.
Your daily going out and in your door
the LORD will keep both now and evermore.
