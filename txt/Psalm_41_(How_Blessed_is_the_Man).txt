# How Blessed is the Man who Guides the Poor

How blessed the man who guides the poor
by counsel strong and clear;
The Lord will surely rescue him
when evil days draw near.

-----

The Lord will guard him in the land;
his life is blessed indeed;
Nor will You let him fall before
his adversaries' greed.

-----

The Lord sustains him on his bed
of sickness and of pain.
And from his bed You make him rise;
he will his health regain.

-----

Now as for me, I said, "O Lord,
have mercy on my soul.
Because against You I have sinned,
restore and make me whole."

-----

My foes speak evil things of me
and to each other say,
"When will he die; when will his name
completely pass away?"

-----

And when he comes to visit me
his words are all deceit;
He gathers evil in his heart,
and tells it in the street.
