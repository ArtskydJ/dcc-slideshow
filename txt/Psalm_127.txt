# Psalm 127

Except the LORD shall build the house
The builders lose their pain;
Except the LORD the city keep
The watchmen watch in vain.

-----

'Tis vain for you to rise betimes,
Or late from rest to keep,
To eat the bread of toil;
For so He gives His loved ones sleep.

-----

Lo, children are the LORD's good gift;
Rich payment are men's sons.
The sons of youth as arrows are
In hands of mighty ones.

-----

Who has his quiver filled with these,
O happy shall he be;
When foes they greet within the gate
They shall from shame be free.
