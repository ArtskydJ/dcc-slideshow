# Easter Song

Hear the bells ringing they're singing
that you can be born again.
Hear the bells ringing they're singing
Christ is risen from the dead.

-----

The angel upon the tombstone said,
"He is risen just as he said.
Quickly now go tell his disciples
that Jesus Christ is no longer dead!"

-----

Joy to the world.
He is risen alleluia!
He's risen alleluia!
He's risen alleluia, alleluia!

Hear the bells ringing they're singing
that you can be born again.
Hear the bells ringing they're singing
Christ is risen from the dead.

The angel upon the tombstone said,

Quickly now go tell his disciples
that Jesus Christ is no longer dead!"

-----

Joy to the world.
He is risen alleluia!
He's risen alleluia!
He's risen alleluia, alleluia!
