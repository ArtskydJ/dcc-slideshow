Exalt the Lord our God,

worship at His footstool. 
Holy is He, holy is He.

enthroned in the heavens, 
Word of the Father,
exalted for us.

-----

We have a hope
that is steadfast and certain, 
gone through the curtain
and touching the throne. 
We have a Priest
who is there interceding, 
pouring His grace
on our lives day by day.

Exalt the Lord our God,
exalt the Lord our God; 
and worship at His footstool,
worship at His footstool. 
Holy is He, holy is He.

We come to Him,
our Priest and Apostle, 
clothed in His glory
and bearing His name; 
laying our lives
with gladness before Him; 
filled with His Spirit
we worship the King.

-----

O holy One,
our hearts do adore You; 
thrilled with Your goodness
we give You our praise. 
Angels in light
with worship surround Him, 
Jesus, our Saviour,

Exalt the Lord our God,
exalt the Lord our God; 
and worship at His footstool,
worship at His footstool.

# Law & Confession of Sin

(Leader) "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me shall never walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life." (John 8:12)
Let us therefore bring our sins into His light. 

-----

Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking, as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby. Beloved, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul, having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles. Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether to the king as supreme, or to governors. 

-----

Live as free, yet do not use your liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God. Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king." (1Peter 2:1-3,11-14,17)
You have heard the Law of God. This past week, did you keep God's Law perfectly?
(All) We have not kept God's Law perfectly.

-----

Let us approach the throne of grace and confess our sins, so that we may receive mercy and find grace.
"Save Your servant who trusts in You!
Be merciful to me, O Lord, for I cry to You all day long. For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, and abundant in mercy to all those who call upon You." (Psalm 86:2-5)

-----

On what basis do you believe God's favor and love will continue towards you?
"Our only comfort in life and in death is that we are not our own, but belong to our faithful Savior Jesus Christ. 
He has fully paid for all of our sins with His precious blood, and has set us free from the tyranny of the Devil!"
(from the Heidelberg Confession)

# Lord Jesus, Think On Me

Lord Jesus think on me 
And purge away my sin.
From earthborn passions set me free
And make me pure within.

-----

Lord Jesus think on me 
With anxious thoughts oppressed. 
Let me Your loving servant be 
And taste Your promised rest.

-----

Lord Jesus think on me 
Nor let me go astray. 
Through darkness and perplexity 
Point out Your chosen way.

-----

Lord Jesus think on me 
That when the flood is past
May the eternal brightness see
And share Your joy at last,
And share Your joy at last.

# Reading of the Gospel

(Leader)Brothers and sisters, does God hold you accountable for your sin?
(All)No! "He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness, and brought us into the kingdom of the Son He loves!" (Colossians 1:13)

-----

Does the Law of God condemn you?
It does not!
"He has wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us!
He has taken it out of the way,
having nailed it to the cross!" (Col. 2:14b)

-----

Will God ever change His mind about you?
Never! Our God has said, "I will never leave you! I will never forsake you!" (Hebrews 13:5b) 
Will God ever forget you?
Never! He has said, "I will never forget you!
I have engraved you on the palms of My hands!" (Isaiah 49:15b,16a)

-----

Children of God, know that your sins are forgiven,
that you are dearly loved by the Father, and be at peace with your God!
"Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
(1Cor. 15:57) 

-----

Come, Let us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation!
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving!
For the Lord is the great God, the great King above all gods! (from Psalm 32:11)

# When I Survey The Wondrous Cross 

When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

-----

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God.
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

-----

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down:
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

-----

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an off'ring far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.
Amen, amen, amen, amen!

# Sing Praise to the Lord (Psalm 149)

Sing praise to the Lord; come sing a new song.
Amid all His saints His praises prolong.
Let Israel be glad in their Maker and sing;
let all Zion's people rejoice in their King.

-----

With timbrel and harp and joyful acclaim, 
with dancing and song give praise to His name.
For God in His people His pleasure will seek,
with robes of salvation adorning the meek. 

-----

In glory exult, you saints of the Lord;
with songs in the night high praises accord.
Go forth in His service, be strong in His might
to conquer all evil and stand for the right. 

-----

For this is God's word: His saints shall not fail,
but over the earth their pow'r shall prevail.
All kingdoms and nations shall yield to their sword Thus God shows his glory. Sing praise to the Lord!

> Psalm 149. William Croft, 1708

# Let The Heavens Be Glad 

Let the heavens be glad today,
let the people of the earth rejoice.
Sing together in joyful praise
in the hope that we all share.

The Lord is on His way.
He will come to restore all things.
He will judge in righteousness,

Let the nations repent therefore,
let the people of the earth convert,
so that times of refreshing come
from the presence of the Lord.

Thy Kingdom come, O Lord. 
May thy will be done on earth 
as it is in heaven now

# Psalm 27.9-14

Leave me not nor forsake, O God,
Thou savior art to me;
Though both my parents cast me off,
I'm taken up by Thee.

-----

O Lord, instruct me in Thy way,
Do Thou my leader be;
Make plain my path because of those
That hatred bear to me.

-----

Nor give me to my foe's desire;
For witnesses that lie
against me risen are,
And such as breathe out cruelty.

-----

I should have fainted had I not
believed that I would see
Jehovah's goodness in the land
of them that living be.

-----

O do thou wait upon the Lord,
Yea, let thy strength be great.
And let thy heart encouraged be,
Upon Jehovah wait.
