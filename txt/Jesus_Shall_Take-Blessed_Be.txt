# Jesus Shall Take The Highest Honor

Jesus shall take the highest honor,
Jesus shall take the highest praise; 
Let all earth join heav'n in exalting
the Name which is above all other names. 

-----

Let's bow the knee in humble adoration,
for at his name ev'ry knee must bow. 
Let every tongue confess
he is Christ, God's only Son,
Sovereign Lord we give you glory now. 

-----

For all honor and blessing and power
belongs to you, belongs to you. 
All honor and blessing and power
belongs to you, belongs to you,
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God.

# Blessed Be the Lord God Almighty

Father in heaven, how we love you,
we lift your name in all the earth.
May your kingdom
be established in our praises, 
as your people
declare your mighty works.

-----

Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
who was, and is, and is to come;
blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
who reigns forevermore.
