# Psalm 37:1-6

Have no disturbing thoughts about
those doing wickedly,
and be not envious of those
who work iniquity.

-----

For even like the growing grass
soon be cut down shall they;
and like the green and tender plant
they all shall fade away.

-----

Set thou thy trust upon the Lord;
continue doing good.
Dwell thou securely in the land;
make faithfulness thy food.

-----

Joy in the Lord; He'll grant each gift
for which thy heart may call.
Commit thy way unto the Lord;
trust him; he'll do it all.

-----

And like the morning light he shall
thy righteousness display;
and he thy judgment shall bring forth
like noontide of the day.
