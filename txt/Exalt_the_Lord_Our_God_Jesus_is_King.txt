# Exalt the Lord Our God / Jesus is King

Exalt the Lord our God,
exalt the Lord our God; 
and worship at His footstool,
worship at His footstool. 
Holy is He, holy is He.

-----

Jesus is King
and I will extol Him, 
Give Him the glory
and honor His name.
He reigns on high,
enthroned in the heavens, 
Word of the Father,
exalted for us.

-----

We have a hope
that is steadfast and certain, 
gone through the curtain
and touching the throne. 
We have a Priest
who is there interceding, 
Pouring His grace
on our lives day by day.

-----

Exalt the Lord our God,
exalt the Lord our God; 
and worship at His footstool,
worship at His footstool. 
Holy is He, holy is He.

-----

We come to Him,
our Priest and Apostle, 
clothed in His glory
and bearing His name; 
laying our lives
with gladness before Him; 
filled with His Spirit
we worship the King.

-----

O holy One,
our hearts do adore You; 
thrilled with Your goodness
we give You our praise. 
Angels in light
with worship surround Him, 
Jesus, our Saviour,
forever the same.

-----

Exalt the Lord our God,
exalt the Lord our God; 
and worship at His footstool,
worship at His footstool. 
Holy is He, holy is He.
