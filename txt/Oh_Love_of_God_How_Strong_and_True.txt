# O Love of God, How Strong and True 

O Love of God, how strong and true,
eternal and yet ever new,
uncomprehended and unbought,
beyond all knowledge and all thought! 
O love of God, how deep and great,
far deeper than man's deepest hate;
self-fed, self-kindled like the light, changeless, eternal, infinite. 

-----

O heav'nly love, how precious still,
in days of weariness and ill,
in nights of pain and helplessness,
to heal, to comfort, and to bless! 
O wide embracing, wondrous love!
We read you in the sky above,
we read you in the earth below,
in seas that swell, and streams that flow. 

-----

We read you best in him who came
to bear for us the cross of shame;
sent by the Father from on high,
our life to live, our death to die. 
We read your pow'r to bless and save,
e'en in the darkness of the grave;
still more in resurrection light
we read the fullness of your might.

-----

O love of God, our shield and stay
through all the perils of our way!
Eternal love, in you we rest,
forever safe, forever blest. 
We will exalt you, God and King,
and we will ever praise your name;
we will extol you ev'ry day,
and evermore your praise proclaim.
