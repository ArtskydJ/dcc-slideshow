# God the All-Terrible

God the all-terrible!
King, who ordainest great winds thy clarions, lightings thy sword, 
show forth thy pity on
high where thou reignest; 
give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

-----

God the omnipotent!
Mighty avenger, watching invisible,
Judging unheard,
save us in mercy, O
Save us from danger;
give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

-----

God the all-merciful!
Earth hath forsaken thy ways of
blessedness, slighted thy Word;
bid not thy wrath in its terrors awaken;
Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

-----

Got the all-righteous One!
Man hath defied thee; yet to eternity
standeth thy Word;
falsehood and wrong shall not 
tarry beside thee;
give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

-----

# Good Christian Men, Rejoice

God the all-wise by the
fire of thy chast'ning earth shall to
Freedom and truth be restored;
through the thick darkness thy
Kingdom is hast'ning,
thou wilt give peace in thy time, O Lord.
