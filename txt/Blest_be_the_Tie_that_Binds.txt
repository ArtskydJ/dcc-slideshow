# Blest Be the Tie that Binds

Blest be the tie that binds
our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
is like to that above.

-----

Before our Father's throne
we pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one
our comforts and our cares.

-----

We share our mutual woes,
our mutual burdens bear;
and often for each other flows
the sympathizing tear.

-----

When we asunder part,
it gives us inward pain;
but we shall still be joined in heart,
and hope to meet again.

-----

This glorious hope revives
our courage by the way;
while each in expectation lives,
and longs to see the day.

-----

From sorrow, toil and pain,
and sin, we shall be free,
and perfect love and friendship reign
through all eternity.
