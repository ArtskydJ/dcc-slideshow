# By Your Name, O God (Psalm 54)

By Your name, O God, now save me;
grant me justice by Your strength.
To these words of mine give answer;
O my God, now hear my prayer.
Strangers have come up against me,
even men of violence.
And they seek my life's destruction;
God is not within their thoughts

-----

See how God has been my helper,
How my Lord sustains my soul:
To my foes he pays back evil-
In Your truth destroy them all!
I will sacrifice with gladness;
Your good name I'll praise, O Lord.
He has saved me from all trouble;
I have looked on all my foes.
