# O Lord Most High â€“ Psalm 9

O Lord Most High, with all my heart,
Your great works I will proclaim;
I will be glad and give You thanks
and sing the praises of Your Name.
Hope of the poor to You we cry!
Arise O Lord defend the weak!
Sing Praise to the Lord enthroned on High!
Declare to all His mighty deeds!

-----

The Lord the everlasting King,
Seated on His judgment throne;
The Righteous Judge of all the world
will make His perfect justice known.
Hope of the poor to You we cry!
Arise O Lord defend the weak!
Sing Praise to the Lord enthroned on High!
Declare to all His mighty deeds!

-----

Jehovah will a refuge prove,
Refuge strong for all oppressed,
A safe defense where weary souls
in troubled times may surely rest.
Hope of the poor to You we cry!
Arise O Lord defend the weak!
Sing Praise to the Lord enthroned on High!
Declare to all His mighty deeds!

-----

All they O Lord that know Your Name,
place their trust in the Word of Truth
for You have never turned away
from those who truly seek for You.
Hope of the poor to You we cry!
Arise O Lord defend the weak!
Sing Praise to the Lord enthroned on High!
Declare to all His mighty deeds!
