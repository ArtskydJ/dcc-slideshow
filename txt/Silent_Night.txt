# Silent Night

Silent night! Holy night!
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and Child. 
Holy Infant, so tender and mild 
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

-----

Silent night! Holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar Heav'nly hosts sing: Alleluia,
Christ, the Saviour, is born!
Christ, the Saviour, is born!

-----

Silent night! Holy night!
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth,
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth.
