# Cast Your Burden on the Lord

Cast your burden on the Lord,
only lean upon his word; 
you will soon have cause to bless his eternal faithfulness.

-----

He sustains you by his hand,
he enables you to stand; 
those whom Jesus once has loved from his grace are never moved.

-----

Human counsels come to naught;
that shall stand which God has wrought; 
His compassion love and pow'r are the same forevermore.

-----

Heav'n and earth may pass away,
God's free grace shall not decay; 
He has promised to fulfill all the pleasure of His will.

-----

Jesus guardian of your flock,
be yourself our constant rock; 
make us by your pow'rful hand strong as Zion's mountain stand.
