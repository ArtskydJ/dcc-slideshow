# Psalm 51D

From my sins, O hide Your face; 
My iniquities, erase. O my God, renew my heart, 
and a spirit right impart.
Cast me not from You, I pray; 
Nor Your Holy Spirit take.

-----

Give salvation's joy again,
and a willing mind sustain. 
Then Your perfect ways I'll show
that transgressors may them know; 
sinners are converted then,
turning back to You again

-----

From blood-guiltiness, O God,
set me free, my Savior, 
God. Then my tongue will joy express,
singing of Your righteousness.
Open now my lips, O Lord;
from my mouth will praise be poured.
