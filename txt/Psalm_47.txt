# Psalm 47 

Oh clap your hands you peoples all
and shout to God with triumph voice!
For the Lord Most High is great, 
an awesome King o'er all the earth.

-----

He the peoples will subdue,
and put the nations 'neath our feet.
Shout to God with voice!
With voice of triumph shout!

-----

Oh clap your hands you peoples all
and shout to God with triumph voice!
He will choose our heritage,
the pride of Jacob whom he loved.

-----

God has gone up with a shout,
Jehovah with the ram's horn sound.
Shout to God with voice!
With voice of triumph shout!

-----

Oh clap your hands you peoples all, 
and shout to God with triumph voice!
Praises sing to God, sing praise! 
Sing praises to Our King sing praise!

-----

For God is King o'er all the earth. 
Sing praises with a skillful psalm.
Shout to God with voice!
With voice of triumph shout!

-----

Oh clap your hands you peoples all 
and shout to God with triumph voice!
O'er the nations God doth reign;
God sits upon his holy throne. 
The Nobles of the peoples meet,
of Abraham's God the peoples are.

-----

For earth's shields belong to God;
he is greatly lifted up.
Shout to God with voice!
With voice of triumph shout!
