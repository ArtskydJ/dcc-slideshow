# My Heart is Firmly Fixed 

My heart is firmly fixed;
to God my song I raise. 
Awake, O harp, in joyful strains;
awake, my soul, to praise.

-----

How great your love, O Lord:
we praise your match-less worth.
Your glory be exalted high
and cover all the earth. 

-----

Stretch forth your mighty hand
in answer to our prayer,
and let your own beloved ones
your great salvation share.

-----

God speaks: &All lands are mine,
to serve me and obey;
my people and their foes will serve
my glory day by day.& 

-----

O who will lead us on
in triumph on this day?
Lord, why do you reject your own
and turn your face away?

-----

An army's help is vain;
to God for help we plead. 
With God we shall do valiantly;
with God we shall succeed.

-----

Among the nations Lord,
to you my song will rise. 
Your faithfulness out shines the heavens,
your mercies reach the skies.
