# Psalm 2

Why do Gentile nations rage?
And their useless plots design?
Kings of Earth in schemes engage,
rulers are in league combined.

-----

They speak out against the Lord;
His Messiah they defy:
"Let us break their chains and cords,
let us cast them off," they cry.

-----

He who sits in heaven laughs,
for the Lord views them with scorn.
He will speak to them in wrath,
and in anger He will warn:

-----

"Yet according to my will
I have set my king to reign,
and on Zion's holy hill
my anointed I'll maintain."

-----

"I the Lord's decree make known;
this is what He had to say:
He declared, 'You are my son;
I have brought you forth this day.

-----

Ask of me, and you I'll make
heir to earth and nations all.
them with iron rod you'll break,
smashing them in pieces small."

-----

Therefore kings now heed this word:
Earthly judges, come and hear.
Reverent worship give the Lord;
With your joy mix trembling fear.

-----

Honor him, his wrath to turn,
lest you perish in your stride,
for his anger soon may burn. 
Blessed are all who in him hide.
