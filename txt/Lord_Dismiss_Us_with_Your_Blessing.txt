# Lord, Dismiss Us with Your Blessing

Lord, dismiss us with your blessing;
Fill our hearts with joy and peace;
Let us each, your love possessing,
triumph in redeeming grace;
O refresh us, O refresh us,
trav'ling through this wilderness.

-----

Thanks we give and adoration for your Gospel's joyful sound;
May the fruits of your salvation
In our hearts and lives abound;
Ever faithful, ever faithful
to the truth may we be found;

-----

So that when your love shall call us,
Savior, from the world away,
Let no fear of death appall us,
Glad your summons to obey:
May we ever, may we ever
reign with you in endless day.
