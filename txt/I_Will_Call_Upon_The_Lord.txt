# I Will Call Upon the LORD (Psalm 18)

I will call upon the LORD
I will call upon the LORD 
Who is worthy to be praised.
Who is worthy to be praised.
So shall I be saved from my enemies.
 So shall I be saved from my enemies.
I will call upon the LORD.

I will love you, LORD, my strength.
I will love you, LORD, my strength.
You're my Rock and my strong tow'r.
You're my Rock and my strong tow'r.
You're my Strength in whom
I will put my trust.
 You're my Strength in whom
 I will put my trust.
I will call upon the LORD.

> Men. Women. Men. Women. Men. Women. All

The LORD liveth! and blessed be the Rock;
and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
The LORD liveth! and blessed be the Rock;
and let the God of my salvation be exalted.

I can run against a troop.
As for God His way is true.
By my God, can leap a wall.
Yes! His word is proven sure.
He's a shield to all those who trust in Him.
You're our shield and we put our trust in You.
We will call upon the LORD.

Who is God except the LORD?
Who's a rock, except our God?
It is God who arms my strength.
Makes my life completely whole.
Makes my feet secure like a deer's feet.
Leads me safely on mountain places.
I will call upon the LORD.

> Men. Women. Men. Women. Men. Women. All

-----

The LORD liveth! and blessed be the Rock;
and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
The LORD liveth! and blessed be the Rock;
and let the God of my salvation be exalted.

> All

-----

The LORD liveth! and blessed be the Rock;
and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
The LORD liveth! and blessed be the Rock;
and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
