# Give Thanks to the Lord 

Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
in light inaccessible hid from our eyes
most blessed most glorious,
the Ancient of Days,
almighty, victorious
thy great name we praise.

-----

Give thanks to the Lord for his righteousness,
give thanks to the Lord for his love. 
Let us worship his name and his holiness. 
Give tha--nks to the Lord,
oh, give tha--nks to the Lord,
give tha--nks. 

-----

Give thanks to the Lord,
for the works of his hand,
for a kingdom that cannot be shaken. 
Give thanks to the Lord
for we all now can stand
and fear not of being forsaken.

-----

Give thanks to the Lord
for his righteousness,
give thanks to the Lord for his love. 
Let us worship his name and his holiness. 
Give tha--nks to the Lord,
oh, give tha--nks to the Lord,
give tha--nks. 

-----

Thanks to the Father for sending his son. 
Give thanks to the Son for the Spirit. 
Now lift up your voices to God
three in One,
and shout so the whole world can hear it.

-----

Give thanks to the Lord for his righteousness,
give thanks to the Lord for his love. 
Let us worship his name and his ho--liness. 
Give tha--nks to the Lord,
oh, give tha--nks to the Lord.

Give thanks to the Lord for his righteousness,
give thanks to the Lord for his love. 
Let us worship his name and his ho--liness. 
Give tha--nks to the Lord,
oh, give tha--nks to the Lord,
give tha--nks.
