I'll give you praise, my God, O King,
I will forever bless your name; 
I will extol you every day,
and ever more your praise proclaim. 

-----

Great is the Lord, deserving praise;
His greatness none can comprehend.
One generation to the next
will all your mighty works commend.

-----

I'll contemplate your wondrous works,
your splendor and your glory great.
Men will declare your awesome acts;
Your power and greatness I'll relate.

-----

Calling to mind your goodness great,
its fame they eagerly express; 
And they sing praises joyfully,
telling of all your righteousness.
