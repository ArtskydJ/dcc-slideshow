# Psalm 23

The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want;
He makes me lie in pastures green.
He leads me by the still, still waters,
His goodness restores my soul.

-----

He guides my ways in righteousness; 
  guides my ways for His own name's sake;
and He anoints my head with oil; 
You anoint my head with oil; 
and my cup, it overflows with joy,
I feast on His pure delights.

> Men: . Women: . Men:. Women:. All:   

-----

And though I walk the darkest path 
  though I walk through the valley, Lord,
I will not fear the evil one, 
of the shadow of death, be near, 
for You are with me, and Your rod and staff
are the comfort I need to know.

> Men: . Women: . Men:. Women:. All:   

-----

And I will dwell within Your house. 
  set a table before me Lord,
Yes, all the days of my life.
in the presence of all my foes 
For Your endless mercy follows me,
Your goodness will lead me home. 
Forever I'll trust You, Lord.
