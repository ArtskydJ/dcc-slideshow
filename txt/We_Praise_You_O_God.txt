# We Praise You, O God, Our Redeemer, Creator

We praise You, O God, our Redeemer, Creator;
In grateful devotion our tribute we bring.
We lay it before You, we kneel and adore You;
We bless Your holy name, glad praises we sing.

-----

We worship you, God of our fathers, we bless You;
Through life's storm and tempest our guide You have been.
When perils o'er take us, escape You will make us,
And with Your help, O Lord, our battles we win.

-----

With voices united our praises we offer
to You, great Jehovah, glad anthems we raise.
Your strong arm will guide us,
our God is beside us,
To You, our great Redeemer, forever be praise!
