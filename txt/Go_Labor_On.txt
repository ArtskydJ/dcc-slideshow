# Go Labor On 

Go, labor on: spend, and be spent,
your joy to do the Father's will:
it is the way the Master went;
should not the servant tread it still?

-----

Go, labor on! 'tis not for naught
your earthly loss is heavenly gain;
men heed you, love you, praise you not;
the Master praises: what are men?

-----

Go, labor on! enough, while here,
if he shall praise you, if he deign
the willing heart to mark and cheer:
no toil for him shall be in vain.

-----

Go, labor on while it is day:
the world's dark night is hastening on;
speed, speed your work, cast sloth away;
it is not thus that souls are won.
