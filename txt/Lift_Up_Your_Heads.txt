# Lift Up Your Heads

Wise men of old and all people now
honor him with gifts, come sing and bow.
Christ the prophesied, to be crucified;
born a Savior, Mediator, to be magnified.

-----

Raised from the dead, to his throne on high
hear his shout of triumph from the sky.
Demon princes fall, flee before his call
the accuser of the brethren, sees him Lord of all.

-----

Lift up your heads to the coming King
bow before him and adore him. Sing
to his majesty let your praises be
pure and holy, giving glory to the King of kings.
