# Kingdom Beginnings

These are the days of Elijah
declaring the Word of the Lord. 
And these are the days of your servant Moses
righteousness being restored. 

-----

And though these are days of great trials
of famine and darkness and sword.
Still we are the voice in the desert crying,
"Prepare ye the way of the Lord."

-----

Behold he comes
riding on the clouds, 
shining like the sun,
at the trumpet call.
So lift your voice,
it's the year of Jubilee,
and out of Zion's hill Salvation comes.

-----

And these are the days of Ezekiel,
the dry bones becoming as flesh. 
And these are the days of your servant David
rebuilding a temple of praise. 

-----

And these are the days of the harvest,
the fields are as white in the world. 
And we are the laborers In your vineyard declaring the Word of the Lord.

-----

Behold he comes
riding on the clouds, 
shining like the sun,
at the trumpet call.
So lift your voice,
it's the year of Jubilee,
and out of Zion's hill Salvation comes.

-----

Behold he comes
riding on the clouds, 
shining like the sun,
at the trumpet call.
So lift your voice,
it's the year of Jubilee,
and out of Zion's hill Salvation comes.
