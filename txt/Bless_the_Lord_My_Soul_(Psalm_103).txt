# Bless the Lord, My Soul (Psalm 103)

Bless the Lord, my soul. My whole heart,
ever bless His holy name. 
Bless the Lord, my soul. Forget not
all His blessings to proclaim. 
He forgives all your transgressions,
your diseases all He heals. 
He redeems you from destruction,
and with you He kindly deals.

-----

He with love and mercy crowns you,
satisfies your years with good; 
so that you will, like the eagle,
with youth's vigor be renewed. 
He shall intervene with justice
for all those who are oppressed; 
for their sake the Lord takes action,
governing in righteousness.

-----

He reveals His deeds to Isr'el,
and made Moses know His path. 
Lord of grace and full of pity,
rich in love and slow to wrath! 
He will not continue striving,
nor be angry constantly; 
has not dealt with us as sinners,
punishing iniquity.

-----

For as high as are the heavens
far above the earth below, 
just as great to those who fear Him
is the steadfast love He'll show. 
Far as east from west is distant,
He has put away our sin. 
Like the pity of a father,
has the Lord's compassion been.

> Music by John Zundel, 1870.
