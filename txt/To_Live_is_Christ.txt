# To Live is Christ

I rejoice, for through your prayers,
and the help of Jesus' Spirit,
all these present trials will turn
to deliverance.

-----

My sure hope and expectation
is that I will not be shamed,
but that Christ will gain the glory
in my life or death.

-----

To live is Christ, to be His servant.
To die and live with Him is gain.
Though as I live, may fruitful labor
glorify His name, glorify His name.

-----

Our desire is to depart,
be with Christ upon that day,
though now we are called to live,
live in joy and faith.

-----

To live is Christ, to be His servant.
To die and live with Him is gain.
Though as I live, may fruitful labor
glorify His name, glorify His name.
