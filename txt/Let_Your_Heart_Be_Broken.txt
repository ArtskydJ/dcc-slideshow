# Let Your Heart Be Broken

Let your heart be broken for a world in need
Feed the mouths that hunger, soothe the wounds that bleed,
Give the cup of water and the loaf of bread
Be the hands of Jesus, serving in His stead.

-----

Here on earth applying principles of love
Visible expression God still rules above,
Living illustration of the Living Word
To the minds of all who've never seen and heard

-----

Blest to be a blessing, privileged to care,
Challenged by the need apparent everywhere,
Where mankind is wanting fill the vacant place,
Be the means through which the Lord reveals His grace.

-----

Let your heart be tender and your vision clear
See mankind as God sees, serve Him far and near;
Let your heart be broken by a brother's pain,
Share your rich resources give and give again
