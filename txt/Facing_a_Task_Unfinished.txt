# Facing a Task Unfinished

Facing a task unfinished,
that drives us to our knees; 
a need that, undiminished,
rebukes our slothful ease.

-----

We, who rejoice to know Thee,
renew before thy throne 
the solemn pledge we owe Thee
to go and make Thee known.

-----

Where other lords beside Thee
hold their unhindered sway, 
where forces that defied Thee
defy Thee still today. 

-----

With none to heed their crying
for life, and love, and light, 
unnumbered souls are dying,
and pass into the night.

-----

We bear the torch that flaming
fell from the hands of those 
who gave their lives proclaiming
that Jesus died and rose. 

-----

Ours is the same commission,
the same glad message ours, 
fired by the same ambition,
to Thee we yield our powers.

-----

O Father who sustained them,
O Spirit who inspired, 
Saviour, whose love constrained them
to toil with zeal untired. 

-----

From cowardice defend us,
from lethargy awake! 
Forth on Thine errands send us
to labour for Thy sake.
