# O Sacred Head Now Wounded

O sacred Head, now wounded,
with grief and shame weighed down, 
now scornfully surrounded
with thorns Your only crown: 
how pale You are with anguish,
with sore abuse and scorn, 
how does that visage languish,
which once was bright as morn!

-----

What You, my Lord, did suffer
was all for sinners' gain; 
mine, mine was the transgression,
but yours the deadly pain. 
Lo, here I fall, my Savior;
'tis I deserve your place; 
look on me with your favor,
assist me with your grace.

-----

What language shall I borrow
to thank thee, dearest Friend
For this thy dying sorrow,
thy pity without end?
O make me thine for ever;
and should I fainting be,
Lord, let me never, never
outlive my love to thee.
