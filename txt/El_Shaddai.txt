# El Shaddai

El Shaddai, El Shaddai, - God Almighty
El Elyon na Adonai, - God Most High, oh Lord
age to age You're still the same,
by the power of the name. 
El Shaddai, El Shaddai, - God Almighty
Erkamka na Adonai, - We love You, O Lord
we will praise and lift You high,
El Shaddai. – God Almighty

-----

Through Your love and through the ram
You saved the son of Abraham;
through the power of Your hand
You turned the sea into dry land.
To the outcast on her knees
You were the God who really sees,
and so by Your might you set
Your children free.

-----

Through the years You made it clear
that the time of Christ was near, 
though the people couldn't
see what Messiah ought to be.
Though Your Word contained the plan,
they just could not understand,
Your most awesome work was done
in Your Son.

El Shaddai, El Shaddai, - God Almighty

by the power of the name. 
El Shaddai, El Shaddai, - God Almighty
Erkamka na Adonai, - We love You, O Lord
we will praise and lift You high,
El Shaddai. – God Almighty
