# In Christ Alone

In Christ alone my hope is found.
He is my Light, my strength, my song. 
This Cornerstone, this solid ground,
firm through the fiercest drought and storm. 

-----

What heights of love, what depths of peace,
when fears are stilled, when strivings cease. 
My Comforter, my all in all,
here in the love of Christ I stand.

-----

In Christ alone, who took on flesh,
fullness of God in helpless Babe. 
This gift of love and righteousness
scorned by the ones he came to save. 

-----

Till on that cross as Jesus died,
the wrath of God was satisfied, 
for ev'ry sin on him was laid;
here in the death of Christ I live. 

-----

There in the ground his body lay,
light of the world by darkness slain; 
then bursting forth in glorious day,
up from the grave, he rose again!

-----

And as he stands in victory,
sin's curse has lost its grip on me; 
for I am his, and he is mine,
bought with the precious blood of Christ.

-----

No guilt in life, no fear in death:
this is the pow'r of Christ in me. 
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.

-----

No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
can ever pluck me from his hand; 
till he returns, or calls me home,
here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand.
