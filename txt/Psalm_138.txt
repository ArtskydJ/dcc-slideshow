# Psalm 138

With my whole heart I will praise your Name,
before the gods I sing your praise,
for your Name is great and greatly to be praised.
T'ward your holy temple, LORD, I bow.
Giving praises to your Name,
for your truth and lovingkindnesses to us.

-----

You have magnified your Word, O LORD,
lifted it above your Name,
for your Name is great and greatly to be praised.
When I cried out LORD you answered me,
strengthened me within my soul.
I will bless and magnify your holy Name.

-----

All the kings of earth shall praise you LORD,
for your Word which they will hear.
They shall truly sing of all Jehovah's ways.
The LORD is great in glory and though high,
yet the lowly you regard.
But the prideful ones you only know afar.

-----

Though I walk in midst of trouble, LORD,
yet you will preserve my life.
And your outstretched hand will be against my foes.
Your right hand, O LORD, will save my life
and perfect your plans for me.
For your steadfast love endures forevermore.
