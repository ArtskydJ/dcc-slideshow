# Heal Our Land (2 Chronicles 7:14)

If My people
will humble themselves,
humble themselves and pray;
if they seek My face
and humble themselves,
and turn from their wicked ways

-----

I will hear from heaven
and forgive their sin,
I will hear from heaven
and heal their land.

-----

Lord heal our land,
Father heal our land.
Hear our cry
and turn our nation back to You.

-----

Lord heal our land,
hear us, O Lord, and heal our land.
Forgive our sin
and heal our broken land.

-----

Lord we bow our knee,
we humble ourselves,
humble ourselves and pray.
Lord we seek Your face,
we humble ourselves,
and turn from our wicked ways.

-----

Father in your mercy
forgive our sin.
Father in your mercy
come heal our land.

-----

Lord heal our land,
Father heal our land.
Hear our cry
and turn our nation back to You.

-----

Lord heal our land,
hear us, O Lord, and heal our land.
Forgive our sin
and heal our broken land.

-----

Lord heal our land,
Father heal our land.
Hear our cry
and turn our nation back to You.

-----

Lord heal our land,
hear us, O Lord, and heal our land.
Forgive our sin
and heal our broken land.
