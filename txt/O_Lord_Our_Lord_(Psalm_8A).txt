# Psalm 8: O Lord, Our Lord

O Lord, Our Lord, in all the earth How glorious is Your name!
For You have set above the heav'ns Your glory and Your fame.

-----

From infants and from children's lips, You ordered praise to sound
To silence all Your enemies, The wicked to confound.

-----

When I regard the heav'ns You made, Your fingers work I trace;
I see the moon and shining stars Which You have set in place.

-----

I ask myself "What then is man That You should give him thought- 
The son of man, that You to him Such gracious care have brought?"

-----

Yet You create him to be Just less than one divine; 
You gave him honor as a crown, And made his glory shine.

-----

You made him ruler of the works Created by Your hand; 
You placed all things beneath his feet To be in his command:

-----

All sheep and oxen, birds and fish, All beasts both wild and tame. 
O LORD, our Lord, in all the earth How glorious is Your name!
