# Wondrous King, All Glorious 

Wondrous King, all-glorious,
Sov'reign Lord victorious,
O, receive our praise with favor! 

-----

From thee welled God's kindness
though we in our blindness
strayed from thee, our blessed Savior. 

-----

Strengthen thou,
help us now;
let our tongues be singing,
Thee our praises bringing.

-----

Heavens, spread the story
of our Maker's glory,
all the pomp of earth obscuring. 

-----

Sun, thy rays be sending,
thy bright beams expending,
light to all the earth assuring. 

-----

Moon and star,
praise afar,
Him who glorious made you;
the vast heavens aid you.

-----

O my soul, rejoicing,
sing, thy praises voicing,
sing, with hymns of faith adore him! 

-----

All who here have being,
shout, your voices freeing,
bow down in the dust before him. 

-----

He is God
Sabaoth;
praise alone the Savior,
here and there for ever.

-----

Hallelujahs render
to the Lord most tender,
ye who know and love the Savior.

-----

Hallelujahs sing ye,
Ye redeemed, O, bring ye,
hearts that yield him glad behavior. 

-----

Blest are we,
endlessly;
sinless there forever,
ye shall laud him ever.
