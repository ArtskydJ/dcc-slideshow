# Song of Mary (Luke 1:46-55)

My spirit glorifies the Lord,
in God my Savior I rejoice,
for he beheld my humble state
and in his love made me his choice.

-----

All generations from now on,
shall call me blest and spread my fame,
for he has done great things for me
mighty and holy is his name.

-----

His mercy shall extend to those
who fear the Lord from age to age;
he has revealed his mighty arm,
Scatt'ring the proud in all their rage.

-----

He brought down rulers from their thrones,
but lifted those of low degree.
He filled the hungry with good things,
but empty sent the rich away.

-----

He helped his servant Israel,
rememb'ring to be merciful,
keeping his word to Abraham
and to his seed forevermore.
