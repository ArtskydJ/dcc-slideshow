# The Lord is Marching Out

O give thanks to the LORD for his love endures,
O give thanks to the LORD for his love endures,
O give thanks to the LORD for his love endures
 forever, forever.

-----

The Lord is marching out in splendour,
in awesome majesty he rides,
for truth, humility and justice
his mighty army fills the skies. 

-----

O give thanks to the LORD for his love endures,
O give thanks to the LORD for his love endures,
O give thanks to the LORD for his love endures
 forever, forever.
