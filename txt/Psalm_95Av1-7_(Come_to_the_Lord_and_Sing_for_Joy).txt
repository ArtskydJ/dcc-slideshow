# Psalm 95:1-7

Come to the Lord, and sing for joy;
let us our voices raise.
In joyful shouts, let us the rock
of our salvation praise. 
Into his presence let us come
with praise and thankful voice. 
Let us then sing to him with psalms;
with shouts let us rejoice.

The Lord's a mighty God and king;
above all gods he is.
The depths of earth are in his hand;
the mountain peaks are his.
To him the spacious sea belongs,
made by his own command;
and by the working of his hands
he formed the earth's dry land.

O come and let us worship him;
let us with one accord.
In presence of our maker kneel,
and bow before the lord;
because he truly is our god,
and we his chosen sheep,
the people of his pasture land,
whom his own hand will keep.
