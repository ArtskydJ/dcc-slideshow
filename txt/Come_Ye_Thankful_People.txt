# Come, Ye Thankful People, Come

Come, ye thankful people come,
raise the song of harvest home:
all is safely gathered in,
ere the winter storms begin; 
God, our Maker, doth provide for our wants to be supplied:
come to God's own temple,
come, raise the song of harvest home.

-----

All the world is God's own field,
fruit unto His praise to yield;
wheat and tares together sown,
unto joy or sorrow grown: 
first the blade, and then the ear,
then the full corn shall appear:
Lord of harvest, grant that we wholesome grain and pure may be.

-----

For the Lord our God shall come,
and shall take his harvest home;
from his field shall in that day
all offenses purge away; 
give his angels charge at last
in the fire the tares to cast,
but the fruitful ears to store in his garner evermore.

-----

Even so, Lord, quickly come
to thy final harvest home;
gather thou thy people in,
free from sorrow, free from sin;
there forever purified,
in thy presence to abide:
come, with all thine angels,
come, raise the glorious harvest home.
