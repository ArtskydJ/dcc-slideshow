# Before the Throne of God Above

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong, a perfect plea, 
a great High Priest whose name is Love,
Who ever lives and pleads for me. 

-----

My name is graven on His hands,
my name is written on His heart; 
I know that while in heav'n He stands,
no tongue can bid me thence depart,
no tongue can bid me thence depart.

-----

When Satan tempts me to despair,
and tells me of the guilt within, 
upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin. 

-----

Because the sinless Savior died,
my sinful soul is counted free; 
for God the Just is satisfied
to look on Him and pardon me,
to look on Him and pardon me.

-----

Behold Him there! the risen Lamb,
my perfect, spotless righteousness; 
the great unchangeable I AM,
the King of glory and of grace!

-----

One with Himself I cannot die,
my soul is purchased with His blood; 
my life is hid with Christ on high,
with Christ, my Savior and my God,
with Christ, my Savior and my God.
