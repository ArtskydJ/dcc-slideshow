# Wonderful Counselor

The people who walked in the darkness
Have seen a great light come.
The people who dwelled in the shadows
Have seen a new day dawn.

-----

For to us a son is given,
And to us a child is born.
And the kingdom of the heavens
Is on His shoulders.

-----

And His name shall be Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Prince of Peace.
And His name shall be Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Prince of Peace.
Savior of the world.

-----

The gloom of the slave and the prisoner
Has lifted like a cloud.
The ones who were crushed by their burdens
Rejoice and laugh out loud.

-----

And His kingdom will keep on increasing,
His peace will have no end.
He'll bring mercy, truth, and justice
By His own power.

-----

And His name shall be Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Prince of Peace.
And His name shall be Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Prince of Peace.
Savior of the world.
