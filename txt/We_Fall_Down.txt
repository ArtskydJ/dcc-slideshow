# We Fall Down 

Blessed be
the Lord our God
to all eternity. 
The whole earth let
His glory fill.
Amen, so let it be. 

-----

And we cry glory, glory, glory;
and we cry glory, glory, glory;
and we cry glory, glory, glory
to the Lamb. 

-----

Before the fiery
throne of God
angelic armies cry. 
And human millions
join their throng
as earth joins heaven on high.

-----

In singing worthy, worthy, worthy;
in singing worthy, worthy, worthy;
in singing worthy, worthy, worthy
is the Lamb.

-----

We fall down,
we lay our crowns
at the feet of Jesus, 
the greatness of
His mercy and love,
at the feet of Jesus. 

-----

And we cry holy, holy, holy;
and we cry holy, holy, holy;
and we cry holy, holy, holy
is the Lamb. 

-----

And we cry holy, holy, holy;
and we cry holy, holy, holy; 
and we cry holy, holy, holy
is the Lamb. 
Holy, holy, holy is the Lamb.
