# Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise 

Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes, 
Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
Almighty, victorious, Thy great Name we praise.

-----

Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,
Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;
Thy justice, like mountains, high soaring above
Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.

-----

Great Father of glory, pure Father of light,
Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;
all praise we would render; O help us to see
'tis only the splendor of light hideth thee!
