# Not unto us, O Lord of Heaven

Not unto us, O LORD of heaven,
but unto you be glory given;
in love and truth you do fulfill
the counsels of your sovereign will. 
Though nations fail your power to own,
you are the King you reign alone.

-----

The idol gods of heathen lands
are but the work of human hands: 
they cannot see, they cannot speak,
their ears are deaf, their hands are weak.
Like them shall be all those who hold
to gods of silver and of gold.

-----

O Israel, trust in God alone,
the LORD, whose grace and power are known; 
to him your full allegiance yield,
and he will be your help and shield.
All those who fear him God will bless;
his saints have proved his faithfulness. 

-----

All you that fear him and adore,
the LORD increase you more and more;
both great and small who God confess,
you and your children he will bless. 
You all are blest by him who made
the heavens and earth's foundations laid. 

-----

The heavens are God's since time began,
but he has given the earth to man. 
The dead praise not the living God,
but we will sound his praise abroad.
Yes, we will ever bless his name;
O praise the LORD, his praise proclaim.
