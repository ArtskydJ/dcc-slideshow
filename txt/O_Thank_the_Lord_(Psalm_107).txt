# O Thank the Lord (Psalm 107)

O thank the Lord for He is good,
His love endures eternally! 
So let the Lord's redeemed declare,
the ones He from their foes set free; 
He gathered them and brought them forth from east and west, from south and north.

-----

They wandered through the wilderness,
no city found in which to dwell.
Their hunger and their thirst increased,
their souls within grew faint as well.
So to the Lord they cried, hard-pressed,
He rescued them from their distress.

-----

Then to a city forth they went,
He led them on a pathway straight.
So let them to the Lord give thanks
for all His love and wonders great. 
The thirsty soul He satisfies;
with good the hungry He supplies.
