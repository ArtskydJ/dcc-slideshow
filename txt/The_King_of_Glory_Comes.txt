# The King of Glory Comes 

The King of glory comes,
the nation rejoices. 
Open the gates before him,
lift up your voices.

-----

Who is the King of glory?
What shall we call him?
He is Immanuel,
the promised of the ages.

-----

The King of glory comes,
the nation rejoices. 
Open the gates before him,
lift up your voices.

-----

In all of Galilee,
in city or village,
he goes among his people,
curing their illness.

-----

The King of glory comes,
the nation rejoices. 
Open the gates before him,
lift up your voices.

-----

He gave his life for us,
the pledge of salvation.
He took upon himself
the sin of the nations.

-----

The King of glory comes,
the nation rejoices. 
Open the gates before him,
lift up your voices.

-----

He conquered sin and death;
he truly has risen.
And he will share with us
his heavenly kingdom.

-----

The King of glory comes,
the nation rejoices. 
Open the gates before him,
lift up your voices.
