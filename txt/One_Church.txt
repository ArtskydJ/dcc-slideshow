# One Church 

Your hand O God has guided
your church from age to age.
The tale of love is written.
for us on every page.

-----

Our fathers knew your goodness
and we your works record
and each of these bear witness,
one church one faith one Lord.

-----

One church, one faith, one Lord of life;
one Father, one Spirit, one Christ;
one church, one faith, one Lord of life;
one heavenly King ,Lord of all.

-----

Your mercy never fails us
or leaves your work undone.
With Your right hand to help us,
the victory shall be won.

-----

And then with heaven's angels
your name shall be adored,
and they shall praise You singing
one church one faith one Lord.

-----

One church, one faith, one Lord of life;
one Father, one Spirit, one Christ;
one church, one faith, one Lord of life;
one heavenly King, Lord of all.
