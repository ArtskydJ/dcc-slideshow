# The Lord's Prayer

Our Father, Lord of heav'n and earth,
let praise and honor clothe your name. 
Your kingdom come, your will be done;
throughout the world complete your reign. 
Teach us, o Lord, to trust in you
for bread and breath each day anew.

-----

Forgive us, Lord, our sins and debts
as we to debtors show your grace.
Remove us from all tempting paths
and guard us from the devils ways;
for glory, strength, and heavens throne
belong to you, and you alone.
