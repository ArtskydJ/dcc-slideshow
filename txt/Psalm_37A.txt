# Psalm 37A

Do not be angry or outraged
When evil men you see. 
Do not be envious of those
Who do iniquity. 
For they like grass will quickly change,
Will wither and decay. 
Just like a green and tender plant
They soon will fade away.

-----

Trust in the LORD and cultivate
The good that you possess.
Be settled in the land and choose
To live in faithfulness.
Enjoy the LORD and He will give
Your heart's desire to you.
Commit your pathway to the LORD;
Trust Him; He will be true.

-----

He'll manifest your righteousness
As clearly as the light, 
And show the justice of your cause
Like noon-day shining bright.
Before the LORD be still and wait.
For Him wait earnestly.
Do not let schemers anger you
With their prosperity.

-----

Let anger cease to be in you,
And turn away from wrath.
For only evil will result
With anger's aftermath.
For evil-doers will not last;
Cut off, they cannot stand.
But those whose hope is in the LORD,
These will possess the land.

-----

# And so in just a little while
The wicked will not be.
You may seek out where once he lived,
But him you will not see.
As for the humble patient ones,
The land they will possess, 
And there will savor the delight
Of peaceful blessedness.

And so in just a little while
The wicked will not be.
You may seek out where once he lived,
But him you will not see.
As for the humble patient ones,
The land they will possess, 
And there will savor the delight
Of peaceful blessedness.
