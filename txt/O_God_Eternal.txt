# Psalm 63: O God Eternal 

O God eternal, you are my God!
For you I long in body and soul; 
as in a dry and waterless land
I search, I thirst, I faint for you. 

-----

On holy ground your glory I saw;
your steadfast love is better than life. 
I'll bless your name as long as I live
and lift my hands to you in prayer.

-----

You feed my soul as if with a feast
I sing your praise with jubilant lips, 
upon my bed I call you to mind
and meditate on you at night.

-----

For you have been the help of my life;
you take and keep me under your wing. 
I cling to you, and find your support;
O God my joy, you are my God!
