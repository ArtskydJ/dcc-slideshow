# Man of Sorrows

Man of Sorrows! what a name
for the Son of God, who came 
ruined sinners to reclaim:
hal-le-lu-jah! what a Saviour!

-----

Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
in my place condemned he stood, 
sealed my pardon with his blood:
hal-le-lu-jah! what a Saviour!

-----

Guilty, vile, and helpless, we;
spotless Lamb of God was he;
full atonement! can it be?
hal-le-lu-jah! what a Saviour!

-----

Lifted up was he to die,
"It is finished!" was his cry;
now in heav'n exalted high,
hal-le-lu-jah! what a Saviour!

-----

When he comes, our glorious King,
all his ransomed home to bring,
then anew this song we'll sing:
hal-le-lu-jah! hal-le-lu-jah!
hal-le-lu-jah! what a Saviour!
