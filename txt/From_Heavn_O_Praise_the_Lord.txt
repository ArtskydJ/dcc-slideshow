# From Heav'n O Praise the Lord! (Psalm 148)

From heav'n O praise the Lord!
On high the Lord O praise!
All angels, praise accord;
Let all His hosts give praise.

-----

Praise Him on high,
Sun, moon, and star, 
Sun, moon, and star
You heav'ns afar and cloudy sky.

-----

O let them glorify
the Lord's majestic name;
When He spoke from on high,
they into being came.

-----

And He arranged,
Where they should stand, 
Where they should stand
By His command Can not be changed.

-----

From earth O Praise the Lord,
You deeps and all below. 
Wild winds that do His word;
You clouds, fire, hail, and snow; 

-----

Hills low and high,
and cedars tall,
and cedars tall, beasts great and small,
and birds that fly.

-----

Let all the people praise,
and kings of every land, 
Let all their voices raise
who judge and give command. 

-----

By young and old,
by girl and boy 
By girl and boy, His name with joy
should be extolled.

-----

The Lord alone be praised
above the earth and sky!
He for His saints has raised
A king to rule on high;

-----

So praise accord
O Israel 
O Israel, Who near Him dwell, O praise the Lord!
