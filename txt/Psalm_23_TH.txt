The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want:
he makes down to lie in pastures green;
he leadeth me the quiet waters by.

-----

My soul he doth restore again;
and me to walk doth make
within the paths of righteousness,
e'en for his own name's sake.

-----

Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
yet will I fear none ill, for thou art with me; and thy rod and staff me comfort still.

-----

My table thou hast furnished
in presence of my foes;
my head thou dost with oil anoint,
and my cup overflows.

-----

Goodness and mercy all my life
shall surely follow me,
and in God's house forevermore
my dwelling place shall be.
