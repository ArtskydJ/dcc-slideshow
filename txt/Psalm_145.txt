# Psalm 145

My God, O King,
in praise I will exalt you; 
and I will bless
Your name forevermore. 
Yes, everyday
time and again I'll bless You
and praise Your name
both now and evermore.

-----

Great is the LORD. 
How worthy to be praised! 
His greatness is
unsearchable. 
Your works each race
to coming race will praise 
and tell of all
Your mighty acts.

-----

On all Your splendor,
Your majestic glory, 
On all Your wondrous
works, I'll meditate. 
Men tell the power
of all Your works most awesome, 
And I will join,
Your greatness to proclaim.

-----

They'll Your abundant
goodness celebrate; 
With joy they'll sing
Your righteousness. 
The LORD is gracious
and compassionate, 
to anger slow,
and rich in love.

-----

The LORD is good
to all of His creation, 
compassion has
on all that He has made. 
All you have made,
O LORD, with thanks will praise you; 
Your chosen holy
ones will You extol.

-----

The glory of
Your kingdom they will tell, 
The greatness of
Your power proclaim, 
That sons of men
may know Your mighty acts, 
Your kingdom's splendor
glorious.

-----

Your kingdom is
an everlasting kingdom; 
Your rule endures
through generations all. 
The Lord upholds
all those who down are falling 
and raises up
all those who are bowed down.

-----

The eyes of all
on earth look up to You; 
You give them food
all in good time. 
Your opened hand
fills every need of life; 
the LORD is good
to all that live.

-----

The LORD is near
to all who call upon Him, 
to all who call on Him
with purpose true. 
He satisfies the wants
of all who fear Him; 
He hears their cry
and saves them everyone.
