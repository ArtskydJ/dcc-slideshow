O praise the Lord! The man is blessed
who fears the Lord aright,
the man who finds in His commands
his pleasure and delight.

-----

His children will be mighty men
upon the earth renowned;
the generation of the just
in blessing will abound

-----

Abundant riches in his house
will ever be in store;
and his unspotted righteousness
endures forevermore.

-----

Though darkness may surround the just,
to him arises light;
compassionate and merciful,
he follows what is right.

-----

The man is good and truly blessed
who freely gives and lends,
who justly governs his affairs,
who truth and right extends.

-----

There surely is not anything
that ever will him move;
the righteous man's memorial
will everlasting prove.

-----

And when he hears disturbing news
he will not be afraid;
his heart is fixed; his confidence
upon the Lord is stayed.

-----

Established firmly is his heart;
he will not fearful be,
until upon his enemies
he his desire will see.

-----

He has dispersed his wealth abroad
and given to the poor;
his horn with honor shall be raised,
his righteousness endure.

-----

The wicked looks on angrily;
he grits his teeth, dismayed,
but melts away, and his desire
will into nothing fade.
