# Am I a Soldier of the Cross

Am I a soldier of the cross,
a follower of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
or blush to speak His Name?

-----

Must I be carried to the skies
on flowery beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
and sailed through bloody seas?

-----

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
to help me on to God?

-----

Sure I must fight if I would reign;
increase my courage, Lord.
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
supported by Thy Word.

-----

Thy saints in all this glorious war
shall conquer, though they die;
They see the triumph from afar,
By faith's discerning eye.

-----

When that illustrious day shall rise,
and all Thy armies shine
In robes of victory through the skies,
the glory shall be Thine.
