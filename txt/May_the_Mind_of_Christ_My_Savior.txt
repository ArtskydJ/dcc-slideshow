# May the Mind of Christ My Savior

May the mind of Christ, my Savior,
Live in me from day to day,
By His love and power controlling
All I do and say.

-----

May the Word of God dwell richly
In my heart from hour to hour,
So that all may see I triumph
Only through His power.

-----

May the peace of God my Father
Rule my life in everything,
That I may be calm to comfort
Sick and sorrowing.

-----

May the love of Jesus fill me
 As the waters fill the sea;
Him exalting, self abasing,
This is victory.

-----

May His beauty rest upon me,
As I seek the lost to win,
And may they forget the channel,
Seeing only Him.
