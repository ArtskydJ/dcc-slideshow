# Meekness and Majesty

Meekness and majesty,
manhood and Deity,
In perfect harmony,
the Man who is God.
Lord of eternity
dwells in humanity;
Kneels in humility
and washes our feet.

-----

O what a mystery,
meekness and majesty;
Bow down and worship,
for this is your God.
For this is your God.

# Meekness and Majesty 

Father's pure radiance,
perfect in innocence,
Yet learns obedience
to death on a cross.
Suffering to give us life,
conquering through sacrifice,
And as they crucify,
prays, &Father, forgive.&

O what a mystery,
meekness and majesty;
Bow down and worship,
for this is your God.
For this is your God.

# Meekness and Majesty 

Wisdom unsearchable,
God, the invisible;
Love indestructible
in frailty appears.
Lord of infinity,
stooping so tenderly;
Lifts our humanity
to the heights of His throne.

O what a mystery,
meekness and majesty;
Bow down and worship,
for this is your God.
For this is your God.
