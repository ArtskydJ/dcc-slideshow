# Psalm 70

O God, deliver me.
LORD, speed Your help to me;
And let all those who seek my life
Ashamed and humbled be.
Turned back be they, disgraced,
That in my hurt delight;
Appalled by their own shame be they
Who say, "Aha", in spite

-----

Let all who seek Thee joy
And glad in Thee abide.
Let those who Thy salvation love
Say, "God be magnified." 
In need am I and poor;
O God, make haste I pray; 
My Help and my Deliverer,
O LORD, do not delay.
