# Glorious is Thy Name

Blessed Savior, we adore Thee;
We Thy love and grace proclaim. 
Thou are mighty; Thou are holy.
Glorious is Thy matchless name! 

-----

Glorious, glorious, Glorious is Thy name,
Glorious, glorious, Glorious is Thy name,
o Lord!

-----

Great Redeemer, Lord and Master,
Light of all eternal days. 
Let the saints of every nation sing
Thy just and endless praise!

-----

Glorious, glorious, Glorious is Thy name,
Glorious, glorious, Glorious is Thy name,
o Lord!
