# All Consuming Fire

All consuming fire,
You're my heart's desire, 
and I love You dearly, dearly Lord. 

-----

You're my meditation,
and my consolation,
and I love You dearly, dearly Lord. 

-----

Glory to the Lamb,
I exalt the great I AM; 
reigning on
Your glorious throne, 
You are my
eternal home.

-----

And You are so worthy, worthy Lord.
Glory to the Lamb,
I exalt the great I AM; 
reigning on
Your glorious throne, 
You are my
eternal home.
