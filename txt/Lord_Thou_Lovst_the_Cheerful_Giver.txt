# Lord Thou Lov'st the Cheerful Giver

Lord Thou lov'st the cheerful giver,
who with open heart and hand
blesses freely as a river
that refreshes all the land.
Grant us then the grace of giving
with a spirit large and free,
that our life and all our living
we may consecrate to Thee.

-----

We are thine Thy mercy sought us,
found us in death's dreadful way,
to the fold in safety brought us,
nevermore from Thee to stray.
Thine own life Thou freely gavest
as an off'ring on the cross
for each sinner whom Thou savest
from eternal shame and loss.

-----

Blest by Thee with gifts and graces,
may we heed Thy church's call;
gladly in all times and places
give to Thee who givest all.
Thou hast brought us and no longer
can we claim to be our own;
ever free and ever stronger,
we shall serve Thee Lord alone.

-----

Savior Thou hast freely given
all the blessings we enjoy,
earthly store and bread of heaven,
love and peace without alloy;
Humbly now we bow before Thee,
and our all to Thee resign;
for the kingdom pow'r and glory,
are O Lord forever Thine.
