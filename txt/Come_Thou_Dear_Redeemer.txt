# Come, Thou Dear Redeemer

Come Thou come Thou dear Redeemer.
Come Lord Jesus to set us free,
From our fears and sins release us,
Let us find our rest in Thee.
Hope of all the earth Thou art.
Joy of ev'ry longing heart.

-----

Come Thou, come thou dear Redeemer
Born a Child, yet Thou art a King.
Born to reign in us forever.
Now Thy gracious Kingdom bring.
Rule in all our hearts alone,
Raise us to Thy glorious throne. 
Amen. Amen.
