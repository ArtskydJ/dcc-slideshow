# Psalm 33

With gladness in the Lord,
O let the righteous sing!
For when the upright give Him praise,
it is a fitting thing.

-----

So give the Lord your thanks,
with harp your music raise;
And with a ten stringed instrument,
sing out to Him your praise.

-----

And as you sing and play,
your skillfulness employ.
O sing a new song unto Him;
with shouts express your joy.

-----

For upright is the word
the Lord has given us,
And all the works that He has done
were done in faithfulness.

-----

For He seeks righteousness,
and all that's just and fair;
The Lord's love is throughout the earth,
abundant everywhere.
