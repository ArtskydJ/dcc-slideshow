# Lift High the Cross

Lift high the cross,
the love of Christ proclaim, 
Till all the world adore
his sacred name.

-----

Come, brethren, follow where our Savior trod,
Our King victorious, Christ, the Son of God. 
Lift high the cross, the love of Christ proclaim,
Till all the world adore his sacred name.

-----

Led on their way by this triumphant sign,
The hosts of God in conqu'ring ranks combine.
Lift high the cross, the love of Christ proclaim,
Till all the world adore his sacred name.

-----

O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,
As thou hast promised, draw men unto thee. 
Lift high the cross, the love of Christ proclaim,
Till all the world adore his sacred name.

-----

Thy kingdom come, that earth's despair may cease
Beneath the shadow of its healing peace. 
Lift high the cross, the love of Christ proclaim,
Till all the world adore his sacred name.

-----

For Your blest cross which doth for us atone,
Creation's praises rise before Your throne. 
Lift high the cross, the love of Christ proclaim,
Till all the world adore his sacred name.
