I bind unto myself today
the strong name of the Trinity,
by invocation of the same,
the Three in One and One in Three.

I bind this day to me forever,
by pow'r of faith, Christ's incarnation;
his baptism in the Jordan river;
his death on the cross for my salvation;

-----

his bursting from the spiced tomb;
his riding up the heav'nly way; 
his coming at the day of doom;
I bind unto myself to day.

-----

I bind unto myself today
the pow'r of God to hold and lead, 
his eye to watch, his might to stay,
his ear to hearken to my need.

> St. Patrick's Breastplate

-----

The wisdom of my God to teach,
his hand to guide, his shield to ward; 
the word of God to give me speech,
his heav'nly host to be my guard.

Against the demon snares of sin,
the vice that gives temptation force, 
the natural lusts that war within,
the hostile men that mar my course; 

> St. Patrick's Breastplate

-----

or few or many, far or nigh,
in ev'ry place, and in all hours, 
against their fierce hostility,
I bind to me these holy pow'rs.

Against all Satan's spells and wiles,
against false words of heresy, 
against the knowledge that defiles,
against the heart's idolatry, 

> St. Patrick's Breastplate

-----

against the wizard's evil craft,
against the death-wound and the burning, 
the choking wave, the poisoned shaft,
protect me, Christ, till thy returning.

> St. Patrick's Breastplate

-----

Christ be with me, Christ within me,
Christ behind me, Christ before me, 
Christ beside me, Christ to win me,
Christ to comfort and restore me.

> St. Patrick's Breastplate

-----

Christ beneath me, Christ above me,
Christ in quiet, Christ in danger, 
Christ in hearts of all that love me,
Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.

salvation is of Christ the Lord.
