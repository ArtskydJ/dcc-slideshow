# Lord, Speak to Me That I May Speak

Lord speak to me that I may speak
In living echoes of your tone;
As you have sought, so let me seek
your erring children lost and lone.

-----

O teach me, Lord, that I may teach
The precious things you do impart;
And wing my words, that they may reach
The hidden depths of many a heart.

-----

O fill me with your fullness, Lord,
until my very heart o'er flow
In kindling thought and glowing word
your love to tell, your praise to show.

-----

O use me, Lord, even me,
Just as you will and when and where;
Until your blessed face I see,
your rest, your joy, your glory share.
