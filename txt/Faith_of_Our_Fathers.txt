# Faith of Our Fathers! 

Faith of our fathers! living still
in spite of dungeon, fire and sword; 
O how our hearts beat high with joy
whene'er we hear God's glorious word! 
Faith of our fathers, holy faith! 
We will be true to thee till death! 

-----

Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
were still in heart and conscience free; 
and blest would be their children's fate,
if they like them should die for thee! 
Faith of our fathers, holy faith! 
We will be true to thee till death! 

-----

Faith of our fathers! God's great pow'r
shall draw all nations unto thee; 
and through the truth that comes from God,
His people shall indeed be free. 
Faith of our fathers, holy faith! 
We will be true to thee till death!

-----

Faith of our fathers! we will love
both friend and foe in all our strife, 
and preach thee, too, as love knows how
by witness true and virtuous life: 
Faith of our fathers, holy faith! 
We will be true to thee till death!
