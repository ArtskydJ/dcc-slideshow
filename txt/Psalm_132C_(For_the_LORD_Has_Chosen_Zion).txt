# Psalm 132

For the Lord has chosen Zion;
There He has desired to be;
"This my resting place forever;
Here I'll stay, it pleases me.

-----

I'll bless he provision richly;
I'll her poor with bread sustain,
Clothe her priests with My salvation,
then her saints for joy will sing.

-----

I'll make David's power flourish,
My anointed's lamp prepare;
I with shame his foes will cover;
He a shining crown will wear."
