# Psalm 33/I Will Celebrate

I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord,
I will sing to Him a new song.
For Jehovah's Word, is upright and just,
I will sing to Him a new song.

-----

I will praise Him,
praise Him skillfully and loudly.
I will praise His
love for righteousness and justice;

-----

Hallelujah, hallelujah,
hallelujah, hallelujah,
hallelu, hallelujah.
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
hallelujah, hallelujah,
hallelu, hallelujah.

-----

I will celebrate, sing unto the Lord,
I will sing to You a new song.
All Jehovah's work is secure and firm.
I will sing to You a new song.

-----

I will praise You,
praise from the upright is lovely.
I will praise You,
for You fill the earth with goodness.

-----

Hallelujah, hallelujah,
hallelujah, hallelujah,
hallelu, hallelujah.
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
hallelujah, hallelujah,
hallelu, hallelujah.

-----

I will praise You,
shout with joy unto Jehovah.
I will praise You,
I will sing to You a new song.
I will sing to You a new song.
I will sing to You a new song.
