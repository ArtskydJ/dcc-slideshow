# Jesus, I am Resting, Resting

Jesus, I am resting, resting
in the joy of what thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
of thy loving heart.

-----

Thou hast bid me gaze upon thee,
and thy beauty fills my soul,
for by thy transforming power,
thou hast made me whole.

-----

O how great thy loving kindness,
vaster, broader than the sea!
O how marvelous, thy goodness
lavished all on me!

-----

Yes, I rest in thee, Beloved,
know what wealth of grace is thine,
know thy certainty of promise
and have made it mine.

-----

Simply trusting thee, Lord Jesus,
I behold thee as thou art,
and thy love, so pure, so changeless,
satisfies my heart;

-----

satisfies its deepest longings,
meets, supplies its ev'ry need,
compasseth me round with blessings:
thine is love indeed.

-----

Jesus, I am resting, resting
in the joy of what thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
of thy loving heart.

-----

Ever lift thy face upon me
as I work and wait for thee;
resting 'neath thy smile, Lord Jesus,
earth's dark shadows flee.

-----

Brightness of my Father's glory,
sunshine of my Father's face,
keep me ever trusting, resting,
fill me with thy grace.

-----

Jesus, I am resting, resting
in the joy of what thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
of thy loving heart.

-----

O, Jesus, I am resting, resting
in the joy of what thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
of thy loving heart.
