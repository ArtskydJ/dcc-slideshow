# Not by Might but by My Spirit

Not by might but by My Spirit,
says the Lord. 
Not by pow'r but in My strength you shall go forth.
Vict'ry is yours before the battle begins.
Not by might, not by power but by My Spirit, says the Lord.

-----

All honor to You, Father, and all glory to Your Son, and all praise to Your Spirit, three in One.
We will sing God's praise all the rest of our days, singing glory, glory, glory, glory to You Lord.

-----

For whom shall we fear with the Lord on our side?
For His word is mightier than the sword.
What can man do? For the Lord will see us through.
Not by might, not by power but by My Spirit, says the Lord.

-----

All honor to You, Father, and all glory to Your Son, and all praise to Your Spirit, three in One.
We will sing God's praise all the rest of our days, singing glory, glory, glory, glory to You Lord.
