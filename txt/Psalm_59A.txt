# Free Me, My God (Psalm 59A) 

Free me, my God, from all my enemies;
from those who rise against me, keep me safe.
Save me from those who work iniquity;
deliver me from men who thirst for blood.

-----

See how they lie in ambush for my life;
fierce men have launched attacks against me now;
they quickly come, opposing me, O LORD,
for no offense nor sin, no guilt of mine.

-----

Arouse to meet me and behold my plight.
LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel,
awake to punish nations everywhere;
to wicked, treacherous men, no favor show.

-----

They come at evening snarling like a dog;
and they encircle all the city wall.
See evil things that spew forth from their mouth;
their lips are swords, they think you will not hear.

-----

But you, O LORD, will laugh at them in scorn;
you scoff at all the nations in disdain.
I wait for you, because you are my strength;
truly a mighty stronghold is my God.
