# Evermore, O Lord (Psalm 119)

Evermore, O Lord, in heaven
there Your word forever stands. 
You are faithful through all ages;
Earth stands firm, set by Your Hands. 
All things stand as You determine;
doing all that You decide. 
If Your law had not enthralled me,
in distress I would have died.

-----

I will not forget Your precepts,
You by them my life renew.
I belong to You. O save me!
I have sought Your precepts true.
Though the wicked plot to kill me;
on Your words I meditate.
I've seen bounds to all perfection;
Your commandment's breadth is great.
