# Come and Rejoice

Come with rejoicing;
the Father is calling
those who would worship
in spirit and truth. 
Come with your singing;
come with thanksgiving;
Jesus our Savior has made all things new. 

-----

Come and rejoice,
O holy nation,
come and sing praises to Him. 
Come and bow down;
worship before Him,
Jesus the King of all kings,
Jesus the King of all kings. 

-----

The Lord of creation
is full of compassion,
seated in splendor,
adorned with all grace. 
Majestic and glorious,
reigning victorious,
now and forever enthroned on our praise. 

-----

Come and rejoice,
O holy nation,
come and sing praises to Him. 
Come and bow down;
worship before Him,
Jesus the King of all kings,
Jesus the King of all kings. 

-----

With the sound of the trumpet
He summons the nations,
calling a priesthood to go in His name,
to show forth His power to this generation, to worship before Him,
a kingdom of praise. 

-----

Come and rejoice,
O holy nation,
come and sing praises to Him. 
Come and bow down;
worship before Him,
Jesus the King of all kings,
Jesus the King of all kings. 

-----

Come and rejoice,
O holy nation,
come and sing praises to Him. 
Come and bow down;
worship before Him,
Jesus the King of all kings,
Jesus the King of all kings.
Jesus, the King of all kings.
