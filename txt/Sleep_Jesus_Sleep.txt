# Sleep Jesus Sleep

Sleep Jesus sleep
We've come to see 
You who never closed Your eyes
Watching over earth and skies 
Now in frail humanity must sleep.

-----

Sleep newborn King
We'll gently sing 
You who reigns forevermore
Ruling as the Lord of lords 
You who never had a need must sleep.

-----

Sovereign One
Born as Mary's son 
Prince of Peace
One day You'll deliver me, Deliver me

-----

But now sleep Son of God
We'll watch in awe 
You'll fulfill the Father's plan
Reconciling God and man 
Now Your promises to keep Must sleep
