# Psalm 3

How are they increased that trouble me,
many are they that rise up against me;
many are they that say of my soul, 
"There is no help for him in God!"

-----

But Thou, O LORD, art a shield for me,
my glory and the lifter of my head!
Arise, O LORD Save me, O my God!
Salvation belongs to the LORD. 

-----

I cried to the LORD with my voice,
And He heard me from His holy hill.
I lay down and slept; I awoke for the LORD sustained me.

-----

I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people
Who have set themselves against me round about.

-----

You have struck all my enemies,
On the cheekbone You have struck them.
You have broken their teeth,
Broken the teeth of the wicked.

-----

But Thou, O LORD, art a shield for me,
my glory and the lifter of my head!
Arise, O LORD Save me, O my God!
Salvation belongs to the LORD.

-----

But Thou, O LORD, art a shield for me,
my glory and the lifter of my head!
Arise, O LORD Save me, O my God!
Salvation belongs to the LORD.
Salvation belongs to the LORD.
Your blessing is upon Your people.
