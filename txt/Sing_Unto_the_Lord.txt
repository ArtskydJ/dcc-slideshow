# Sing Unto the Lord

Sing unto the Lord a new song,
sing unto the Lord all the earth. 
Sing unto the Lord and bless him,
day to day proclaim his glorious news.

-----

Sing unto the Lord a new song,
sing unto the Lord all the earth. 
Show his glory to the nations,
to all peoples show his wondrous signs. 

-----

For God is great
and greatly to be praised. 
He's to be feared above all gods. 

-----

Sing unto the Lord a new song,
sing unto the Lord all the earth. 
Give unto the Lord O families,
give unto the Lord his glory due. 

-----

For God is great
and greatly to be praised. 
He's to be feared above all gods. 
For God is great
and greatly to be praised. 
He's to be feared above all gods.

-----

Sing unto the Lord a new song,
sing unto the Lord all the earth. 
Say to all the earth the Lord reigns,
he shall judge the peoples righteously.
