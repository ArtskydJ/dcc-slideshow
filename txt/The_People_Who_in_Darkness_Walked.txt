# The People Who in Darkness Walked (Is. 9:2-3, 6-7)

The people who in darkness walked
have seen a glorious light; 
the heavenly dawn broke forth on those who dwelt in death and night;
to greet you Son of Righteousness,
the gathering nations come.

-----

O tidings of comfort and joy,
comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

-----

To us the promised child is born,
to us a Son is given;
and on his shoulders ever rests
all power in earth and heaven.
The Wonderful, the Counselor,
the Mighty God is he.

-----

O tidings of comfort and joy,
comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

-----

His peace and righteous government
shall over all extend;
on judgment and on justice based,
his reign shall never end;
his name shall be the Prince of Peace forevermore adored.

-----

O tidings of comfort and joy,
comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.
