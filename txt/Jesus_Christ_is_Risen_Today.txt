# Jesus Christ is Risen Today 

Jesus Christ is risen today, Al-le-lu-ia!
our triumphant holy day. Al-le-lu-ia!
Who did once, upon the cross, Al-le-lu-ia!
suffer to redeem our loss. Al-le-lu-ia!

-----

Hymns of praise then let us sing, Al-le-lu-ia!
unto Christ our heav'nly king, Al-le-lu-ia!
Who endured the cross and grave, Al-le-lu-ia!
sinners to redeem and save. Al-le-lu-ia!

-----

But the pains which he endured, Al-le-lu-ia!
our salvation have procured; Al-le-lu-ia!
Now above the sky he's king, Al-le-lu-ia!
where the angels ever sing. Al-le-lu-ia!

-----

Sing we to our God above, Al-le-lu-ia!
praise eternal as his love; Al-le-lu-ia!
Praise him, all ye heav'nly host, Al-le-lu-ia!
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Al-le-lu-ia!
