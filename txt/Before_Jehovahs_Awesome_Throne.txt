# Before Jehovah's Awesome Throne

Before Jehovah's awesome throne,
all nations, bow with sacred joy; 
know that the Lord is God alone,
He can create, and He destroy 
He can create, and He destroy.

-----

His sovereign pow'r, without our aid,
made us of dust and formed us men; 
and when like wand'ring sheep we strayed,
He brought us to His fold again 
He brought us to His fold again.

-----

We'll crowd Your gates with thankful songs, high as the heav'ns our voices raise; 
and earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
shall fill Your courts with sounding praise,
shall fill Your courts with sounding praise.
