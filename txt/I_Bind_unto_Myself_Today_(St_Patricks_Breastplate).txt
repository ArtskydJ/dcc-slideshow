# I Bind Unto Myself Today 

I bind unto myself today
the strong name of the Trinity,
by invocation of the same,
the Three in One and One in Three.

-----

I bind this day to me forever,
by pow'r of faith, Christ's incarnation;
his baptism in the Jordan river;
his death on the cross for my salvation; 

-----

his bursting from the spiced tomb;
his riding up the heav'nly way; 
his coming at the day of doom;
I bind unto myself to day.

-----

I bind unto myself today
the pow'r of God to hold and lead, 
his eye to watch, his might to stay,
his ear to hearken to my need.

-----

The wisdom of my God to teach,
his hand to guide, his shield to ward; 
the word of God to give me speech,
his heav'nly host to be my guard.

-----

Against the demon snares of sin,
the vice that gives temptation force, 
the natural lusts that war within,
the hostile men that mar my course; 

-----

or few or many, far or nigh,
in ev'ry place, and in all hours, 
against their fierce hostility,
I bind to me these holy pow'rs.

-----

Against all Satan's spells and wiles,
against false words of heresy, 
against the knowledge that defiles,
against the heart's idolatry, 

-----

against the wizard's evil craft,
against the death-wound and the burning, 
the choking wave, the poisoned shaft,
protect me, Christ, till thy returning.

-----

Christ be with me, Christ within me,
Christ behind me, Christ before me, 
Christ beside me, Christ to win me,
Christ to comfort and restore me.

-----

Christ beneath me, Christ above me,
Christ in quiet, Christ in danger, 
Christ in hearts of all that love me,
Christ in mouth of friend and stranger. 

-----

I bind unto myself the name,
the strong name of the Trinity, 
by invocation of the same,
the Three in One and One in Three.

# I Bind Unto Myself Today

Of whom all nature hath creation;
eternal Father, Spirit, Word: 
praise to the Lord of my salvation,
salvation is of Christ the Lord.
