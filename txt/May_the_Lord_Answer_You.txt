# May the Lord Answer You (Psalm 20)

May the Lord answer you
when you are in distress,
may the name of God protect you. 
May he send you help from the sanctu'ry
and grant you support from Zion.

-----

May he give to you
the desire of your heart
and make all your plans succeed.
We will shout for joy
when we see you victorious,
and we'll lift up our banners
in the name of our God. 

-----

Some will trust in earthly pow'r,
some will trust in man,
but we will trust in the name of our God.
They are brought down to their knees,
they are doomed to fall,
but we rise up and stand—firm-------.

May the Lord remember all your offerings,
may the Lord accept your sacrifice,
may he send you help from the sanctuary
and grant you support from Zion.

-----

May he give to you
the desire of your heart
and make all your plans succeed.
We will shout for joy
when we see you victorious,
and we'll lift up our banners
in the name of our God. 

-----

Some will trust in earthly pow'r,
some will trust in man,
but we will trust in the name of our God.
They are brought down to their knees,
they are doomed to fall,
but we rise up and stand—firm-------.

-----

O Lord, deliver us,
answer when we call.
O Lord, deliver us,
answer when we call-----.

-----

Now I know Jehovah his anointed saves
and will answer from his holy heav'n.
With the saving strength of his right hand
we will lift up our banners in the name
of our God-------.
May the Lord grant your requests.
