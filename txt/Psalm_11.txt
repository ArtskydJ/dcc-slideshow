# Psalm 11

My trust is in the LORD;
how can you say to me,
"Now like a bird from peril haste
and to your mountain flee!"

-----

The wicked bend the bow
with arrow fixed for flight,
and stealthily in darkness go
the true in heart to smite.

-----

Foundations are destroyed!
What can the righteous do?
The LORD is in His holy place;
the LORD's throne is on high.

-----

His eyes will surely see,
His eyelids test men's sons.
The LORD tries just and wicked men;
His soul hates cruel ones.

-----

Upon all wicked men
He'll rain entangling snares;
brimstone and fire and burning wind
He for their cup prepares.

-----

For righteous is the LORD,
and He loves righteousness;
and every one who upright is
will see His gracious face.
