# Psalm 67 (O God, Show Mercy to Us)

O God, show mercy to us,
and bless us with Your grace, 
and cause to shine upon us
the brightness of Your face;

-----

So that the whole world over
may truly know Your way,
and so that Your salvation
all nations see displayed.

-----

O God, let peoples praise You;
let all the peoples praise;
let nations come rejoicing;
and songs of gladness raise.

-----

For You will judge the peoples
with perfect equity;
to nations of the whole earth
a governor You'll be.

-----

O God, let peoples praise You;
let all the peoples praise.
The earth had brought its bounty
throughout its harvest days.

-----

Since God, our God, will bless us,
yes, God will blessing send,
that all the earth may fear Him
to its remotest end.
