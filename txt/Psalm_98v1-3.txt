# Psalm 98:1-4

O sing a new song to the LORD
for wonders He has done,
for wonders he has done. 
His right hand and his holy arm
the victory have won,
the victory have won,
the victory have won.

-----

The great salvation wrought by him
Jehovah has made known,
Jehovah has made known. 
His justice in the nations' sight
he openly has shown,
he openly has shown,
he openly has shown.

-----

He mindful of his grace and truth
to Isr'el's house has been,
to Isr'el's house has been. 
The great salvation of our God
all ends of earth have seen.
all ends of earth have seen,
all ends of earth have seen.
