# God All Nature Sings Thy Glory

God, all nature sings Thy glory, And Thy works proclaim Thy might; 
Ordered vastness in the heavens, Ordered course of day and night; 
Beauty in the changing seasons, Beauty in the storming sea; 
All the changing moods of nature praise the changeless Trinity.

-----

Clearer still we see Thy hand in Man whom Thou hast made for Thee; 
Ruler of creation's glory, Image of Thy majesty. 
Music, art, the fruitful garden, All the labor of his days,
Are the calling of his Maker To the harvest feast of praise.

-----

But our sins have spoiled thine image; Nature conscience only serve 
As unceasing, grim reminders Of the wrath which we deserve. 
Yet Thy grace and saving mercy In Thy Word of truth revealed 
Claim the praise of all who know Thee, In the blood of Jesus sealed.

-----

God of glory, power, mercy, All creation praises Thee; 
We, Thy creatures, would adore Thee Now and through eternity. 
Saved to magnify Thy goodness, Grant us strength to do Thy will; 
With our acts as with our voices Thy commandments to fulfill.

> David Clowney, 1960. Tune: AUSTRIAN HYMN
