# Psalm 2

Why do heathen nations rage?
Why do peoples folly mind?
Kings of earth in plots engage,
rulers are in league combined;

-----

Then against Jehovah high,
and against Messiah's sway
"Let us break their bands," they cry,
"Let us cast their cords away."

-----

But the Lord will scorn them all;
he will laugh who sits on high.
Then his wrath will on them fall;
sore displeased he will reply:

-----

"Yet according to my will
I have set my king to reign,
and on Zion's holy hill
my anointed I'll maintain."

-----

His decree I will make known:
unto me the Lord did say,
"Thou art my beloved son;
I've begotten thee this day.

-----

Ask of me, and thee I'll make
heir to earth and nations all;
them with iron thou shalt break,
dashing them in pieces small."

-----

Therefore, kings, be wise, give ear' hearken, judges of the earth;
serve the Lord with godly fear;
mingle trembling with your mirth.

-----

Kiss the son, his wrath to turn,
lest ye perish in the way,
for his anger soon will burn. 
Blessed are all that on him stay.
