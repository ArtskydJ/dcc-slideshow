# Take Me In

Take me past the outer courts,
and thru the holy place,
past the brazen altar;
Lord, I want to see your face.

-----

Pass me by the crowds of people,
and the priests who sing their praise;
I hunger and thirst for your righteousness but it's only found one place.

-----

So take me in to the Holy of Holies,
take me in by the blood of the Lamb.
So take me in to the Holy of Holies,
take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am.
