# By Grace I'm Saved, Grace Free and Boundless 

By grace I'm saved, grace free and boundless;
My soul, believe and doubt it not.
Why stagger at this word of promise?
Has Scripture ever falsehood taught?
No, then this word must true remain;
By grace you, too, shall heav'n obtain.

-----

By grace! None dare lay claim to merit;
Our works and conduct have no worth.
God in His love sent our Redeemer,
Christ Jesus, to this sinful earth;
His death did for our sins atone,
And we are saved by grace alone.

-----

By grace! Oh, mark this word of promise
When you are by thy sins oppressed,
When Satan plagues your troubled conscience, And when your heart is seeking rest. 
What reason cannot comprehend
God by His grace to you will send.

-----

By grace! This ground of faith is certain;
So long as God is true, it stands.
What saints have penned by inspiration,
What in His Word our God commands, 
What our whole faith must rest upon,
Is Grace alone, grace in His Son.
