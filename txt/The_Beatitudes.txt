# The Beatitudes

Blest are the humble souls that see
their emptiness and poverty;
treasures of grace to them are giv'n,
and crowns of joy laid up in heaven.

-----

Blest are the men of broken heart,
who mourn for sin with inward smart
the blood of Christ divinely flows,
a healing balm for all their woes.

-----

Blest are the meek, who stand afar
from rage and passion, noise and war;
God will secure their happy state,
and plead their cause against the great.

-----

Blest are the souls that thirst for grace, hunger and long for righteousness;
they shall be well supplied, and fed
with living streams and living bread.

-----

Blest are the men whose hearts do move
and melt with sympathy and love;
from Christ the Lord shall they obtain
like sympathy and love again.

-----

Blest are the pure, whose hearts are clean
from the defiling pow'rs of sin;
with endless pleasure they shall see
a God of spotless purity.

-----

Blest are the men of peaceful life,
who quench the coals of growing strife;
they shall be called the heirs of bliss,
the sons of God, the God of peace.

-----

Blest are the suff'rers who partake
of pain and shame for Jesus' sake;
their souls shall triumph in the Lord
Glory and joy are their reward.
