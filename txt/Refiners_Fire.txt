# Refiner's Fire

Purify my heart,
let me be as gold
and precious silver. 
Purify my heart,
let me be as gold,
pure gold.

-----

Refiner's fire,
my heart's one desire,
is to be holy, set apart for you Lord. 
I choose to be holy,
set apart for you my Master,
ready to do your will.

-----

Purify my heart,
cleanse me from within
and make me holy. 
Purify my heart,
cleanse me from my sin
deep within.

-----

Refiner's fire,
my heart's one desire,
is to be holy, set apart for you Lord. 
I choose to be holy,
set apart for you my Master,
ready to do your will.
