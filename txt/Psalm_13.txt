# Psalm 13 

How long, O LORD?
Will You forget me forever?
How long will You
hide Your face
from me?

-----

How long shall I
take counsel in my soul,
Having sorrow
in my heart daily? 
How long will my
enemy be
exalted over me?

-----

Consider and hear me,
O LORD my God;
Enlighten my eyes,
Lest I sleep
the sleep of death;

-----

Lest my enemy say,  
&I have prevailed against him&;
Lest those who trouble me
rejoice when I am moved.

-----

But I have trusted
in Your mercy.
My heart shall rejoice
in Your salvation.
I will sing
to the LORD, 
Because He
has dealt bountif'lly with me.
