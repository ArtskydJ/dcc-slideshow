# Psalm 46: God is Our Refuge and Strength

God is our refuge and strength,
a present help in our distress.
We will not therefore be afraid
Tho' all the earth should be removed,
Tho' mountains great be hurled
Into the ocean's depths,
Tho' seas may roar and foam
And billows shake the shore,
Tho' mountains tremble at their power.

# God is Our Refuge and Strength

A river brings refreshing streams
to cheer the city of our God,
The Most High's holy dwelling place.
God is in her; she won't be moved;
At dawn will God help her.
The heathen rage; realms quake;
He lifts His voice; earth melts.
The Lord of hosts with us! 
Our fortress strong is Jacob's God.

-----

O come, see what the Lord has done:
He desolations brought on earth;
On earth he puts an end to wars,
breaks bow and spear, and chariots burns. 
Be still! Know I am God.
Exalted O'er all men, exalted o'er all earth. 
The Lord of hosts with us!
Our fortress strong is Jacob's God.
