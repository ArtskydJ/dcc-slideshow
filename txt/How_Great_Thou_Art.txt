# How Great Thou Art

O Lord my God,
when I in awesome wonder,
consider all the works Thy hands have made,
I see the stars,
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

-----

Then sings my soul, my savior God to Thee, how great Thou art! how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my savior God to Thee, how great Thou art! how great Thou art!

-----

When through the woods
and forest glades I wander,
and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
when I look down
from lofty mountain grandeur,
and hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze;

-----

Then sings my soul, my savior God to Thee, how great Thou art! how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my savior God to Thee, how great Thou art! how great Thou art!

-----

And when I think
that God, his Son not sparing,
sent Him to die -- I scarce can take it in.
That on the cross
my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin:

-----

Then sings my soul, my savior God to Thee, how great Thou art! how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my savior God to Thee, how great Thou art! how great Thou art!

-----

When Christ shall come
with shout of acclamation
and take me home -- what joy shall fill my heart! 
Then I shall bow
in humble adoration
and there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!

-----

Then sings my soul, my savior God to Thee, how great Thou art! how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my savior God to Thee, how great Thou art! how great Thou art!
