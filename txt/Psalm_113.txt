# Psalm 113

Praise Jehovah; praise the Lord;
ye his servants praise accord; 
blessed be Jehovah's name;
evermore his praise proclaim,
 evermore his praise proclaim.

-----

From the dawn to setting sun,
praise the Lord, the Mighty One.
O'er all nations he is high;
yea, his glory crowns the sky,
 yea his glory crowns ths sky.

-----

Who is like the Lord our God?
High in heav'n is his abode, 
who himself doth humble low
things in heav'n and earth to know.
 Things in heav'n and earth to know.

-----

He the lowly makes to rise,
from the dust in which he lies, 
that exalted he may stand,
with the princes of the land.
 With the princes of the land.

-----

He the childless woman takes,
and a joyful mother makes; 
keeping house she finds reward,
praise Jehovah; praise the Lord,
 praise Jehovah; praise the Lord.
