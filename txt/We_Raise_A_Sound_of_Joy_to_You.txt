# We Raise A Sound of Joy to You

We raise a sound of joy to you,
the King of kings,
our hearts enthrone you.
High on our praise we place you there,
and we declare
that you alone are God,
are God, God.

-----

Your kingdom knows no end,
secure in your word we stand,
and we shall possess the land,
as step by step we take the ground,
a shout of triumph is our sound of joy
to the King of kings.

-----

We raise a sound of joy to you,
the King of kings,
our hearts enthrone you.
High on our praise we place you there,
and we declare
that you alone are God,
are God, God.

-----

Nations will praise your Name,
submitting before your throne,
and righteousness shall prevail,
as step by step we take the ground,
a shout of triumph is our sound of joy
to the King of kings.

-----

We raise a sound of joy to you,
the King of kings,
our hearts enthrone you.
High on our praise we place you there,
and we declare
that you alone are God.
