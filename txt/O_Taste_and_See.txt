# O Taste and See (Psalm 34)

O taste and see
that the LORD is good,
how blessed is the man
who hides himself in Him. 
I sought the LORD
and He answered me
and set me free
from all my fears.

-----

I will give thanks to Him,
for He is good,
His steadfast love to me
will never end. 
My soul shall boast in Him,
continually,
His praise shall ever be
within my mouth.

O magnify the LORD
together with me,
Let us exalt His Name
forevermore.
