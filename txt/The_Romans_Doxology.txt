# The Roman's Doxology 

Oh the depth of the riches
the wisdom of God,
how unsearchable are His ways.
How profound are His judgments,
so high above our thoughts
and His pathways no man can trace.

-----

For from Him and through Him
and to Him are all things; 
To Him be glory forevermore,
to Him be glory forever. 
Amen, amen, amen.

-----

Oh the depth of the riches
the wisdom of God,
how magnificent are His ways. 
Who has been His advisor
and who has counseled Him,
all He gives us who can repay?

For from Him and through Him

Amen, amen, amen.

# The Roman's Doxology 

Oh the depth of the riches,
the wisdom of God,
how immeasurable is His grace. 
How unfailing His kindness
So far removed His wrath,
And His mercies are new each day.

-----

For from Him and through Him
and to Him are all things; 
To Him be glory forevermore,
to Him be glory forever. 
Amen, amen, amen. Amen, amen.
