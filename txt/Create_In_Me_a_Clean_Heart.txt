# Create in Me a Clean Heart (Psalm 51)

Create in me a clean heart, O God,
and renew a right spirit within me. 
Create in me a clean heart, O God,
and renew a right spirit within me. 

-----

Cast me not away from Thy presence, O Lord,
and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. 
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation,
and renew a right spirit within me.
