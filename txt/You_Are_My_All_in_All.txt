# You Are My All in All

You are my strength when I am weak;
You are the treasure that I seek;
You are my All in All. 

-----

Seeking You as a precious jew'l,
Lord to give up I'd be a fool;
You are my All in All.

Jesus, Lamb of God,
worthy is Your name!

You are my All in All.

when I am dry, You fill my cup.
