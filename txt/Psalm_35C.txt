# Psalm 35

Now men arise to bear false witness;
they ask me things I do not know. 
My good they pay back with their evil;
it fills my heart with grief and woe. 

-----

When they were sick I dressed in sackcloth; 
I fasted with humility; 
But all the prayers I offered for them
would keep returning back to me.

-----

As if they were my friend or brother,
 I went about and grieved aloud;
As though in mourning for my mother,
with deepest sorrow I was bowed.

-----

But at my stumbling they were joyful
assailants all unknown to me; 
Together they conspire against me,
they slander me continually.

-----

Like godless jesters at a party,
they with their teeth have gnashed at me. 
How long, O Lord, will You allow this?
How long look on and let this be? 

-----

Deliver me from their destructions,
and save my life from lions strong. 
I'll thank You in the great assembly,
and praise You in the mighty throng,
and praise You in the mighty throng!
