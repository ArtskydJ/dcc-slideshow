# Sing We Noel

At the name of Jesus Every knee shall bow, Every tongue confess Him
King of Glory now. Sing we Noel.
The King is born, Noel!
Tis the Father's pleasure we should call Him Lord.

-----

Humbled for a season to receive a name
from the lips of sinners
Unto whom He came.
Sing we Noel, the King is born, Noel!
Let His will enfold you in its light and pow'r.

-----

With His Father's glory, O'er the earth to reign; 
For the day is coming
When each knee shall bow,
Sing we Noel, the King is born, Noel!
All our hearts confess Him King of Glory now.
