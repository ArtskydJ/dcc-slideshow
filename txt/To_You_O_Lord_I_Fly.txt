# To You O Lord I Fly

To You, O Lord, I fly and on your help depend; you are my Lord and King most High;
great God, my soul defend.
A heritage for me Jehovah will remain;
my portion rich and full is he, my right
he will maintain.

-----

The lot to me that fell is beautiful and fair;
the heritage in which I dwell
is good beyond compare. 
I praise the Lord above
whose counsel guides aright;
my heart instructs me in his love in seasons of the night.

-----

I keep before me still
the Lord whom I have proved;
at my right hand he guards from ill,
and I shall not be moved. 
Life's pathway you will show,
to your right hand will guide.
Where streams of pleasure ever flow, and boundless joys abide.
