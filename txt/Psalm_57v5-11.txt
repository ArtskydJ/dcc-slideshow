# Psalm 57:5-11 

O be exalted high, O God;
above the heavens stand; 
and let Your glory be above
all earth, both sea and land. 
They spread a net to catch my feet;
my soul was bowed with dread. 
Although they dug a pit for me
they fell in it instead.

-----

My heart is firm, my heart is firm,
O God, I'll praise with song. 
My glory wake, wake, harp and lyre!
My soul will wake the dawn. 
And I will offer thanks to you
among the peoples, Lord; 
and I among the nations will
with song my praise sound forth.

-----

Because your cov'nant love is great,
it reaches heaven high; 
and your unfailing faithfulness
extends up to the sky. 
O be exalted high, O God!
Above the heavens stand, 
and let your glory be above all earth,
both sea and land.
