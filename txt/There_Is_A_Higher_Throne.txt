# There Is A Higher Throne

There is a higher throne
 than all this world has known,
where faithful ones
from ev'ry tongue
will one day come.

-----

Before the son we'll stand
made faultless through the Lamb,
believing hearts
find promised grace;
salvation comes. 

-----

Hear heaven's voices sing
their thund'rous anthem rings,
through em'rald courts
and sapphire skies
their praises rise.

-----

All glory, wisdom, pow'r,
strength, thanks, and honor are 
to God our King
who reigns on high
forevermore. 

-----

And there we'll find our home
our life before the throne,
we'll honor him
in perfect song
where we belong. 

-----

He'll wipe each tear-stained eye
as thirst and hunger die,
the Lamb becomes
our Shepherd King;
we'll reign with him.

-----

Hear heaven's voices sing
their thund'rous anthem rings,
through em'rald courts
and sapphire skies
their praises rise.

-----

All glory, wisdom, pow'r,
strength, thanks, and honor are 
to God our King
who reigns on high
forever more.

-----

All glory, wisdom, pow'r,
strength, thanks, and honor are 
to God our King
who reigns on high
forever more.
