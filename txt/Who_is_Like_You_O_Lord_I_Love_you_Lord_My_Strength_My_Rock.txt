Who is like you, O Lord?
Clothed with splendor and light. 
Who is like you, O Lord?
Armed with power and might. 

-----

And who am I, O Sovereign Lord,
that I should know your love? 
Consuming fire.

-----

O holy majesty,
I know your love 
how great you are, O Lord;
your mercies are ever new. 
O who am I and who is like you?

-----

I love you, Lord, my strength, my rock,
my fortress, and my aid. 
My refuge and salvation's hope,
to you I long have prayed. 

-----

Though cords and snares encompassed me, confronting me with death, 
in my distress I called to you,
my life and source of breath.

-----

In your own courts you heard my plea,
my crying reached your ear. 
The mountains shook, foundations reeled, your anger strikes such fear. 

-----

You came to me on wings of wind,
with storm and lightning's power. 
You saved me from my enemies,
you give me strength each hour.

-----

Your statutes, Lord, I daily read,
that I may know your will. 
Though oft Your Law I fail to keep,
Your love is stead-fast still. 

-----

You pay the righteous with right things,
yet bring the haughty low; 
a perfect shield for all in need,
destruction to your foe.

-----

Who is like you, O Lord?
Clothed with splendor and light. 
Who is like you, O Lord?
Armed with power and might. 

-----

And who am I, O Sovereign Lord,
that I should know your love? 
Consuming fire.

-----

O holy majesty,
I know your love 
how great you are, O Lord;
your mercies are ever new. 
O who am I and who is like you?

-----

For who is God except the Lord,
my rock, my strength, my stay. 
Salvation's shield you give to me,
you widen victory's way. 

-----

Blest be your name, O Living God,
the vict'ry you have won. 
Your name I will proclaim to all,
O saving Sovereign One.
O who am I and who is like you?
