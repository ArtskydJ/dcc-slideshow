# Fill My Cup, Lord

Like the woman at the well I was seeking
for things that could not satisfy;
and then I heard my Savior speaking:
"Draw from my well that shall never run dry."

-----

Fill my cup, Lord I lift it up, Lord!
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more
fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole.

-----

There are millions in this world who are craving the pleasures earthly things afford;
but none can match the wondrous treasure
that I find in Jesus Christ, my Lord. 

-----

Fill my cup, Lord I lift it up, Lord!
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more
fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole.

-----

So, my brother, if the things this world gave you leave hungers that won't pass away,
my blessed Lord will come and save you,
if you kneel to him and humbly pray.

-----

Fill my cup, Lord I lift it up, Lord!
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more
fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole.
