# Psalm 45:1-7

My heart, it over-flows;
a noble theme I sing. 
My tongue's a ready writer's pen,
reciting to the king. 

-----

Most fair among men's sons,
grace on your lips is poured. 
Therefore, his blessing ever-more
has God on you bestowed.

-----

Your sword gird on your thigh,
O you, who mighty are, 
and clothe yourself in majesty;
your glory show afar. 

-----

Victorious, ride in state
for meekness, truth, and right;
and your right hand will teach to you
the fearful deeds of might.

-----

Your arrows sharp will pierce
the hearts of your foes all. 
So those who fight against the king,
beneath you they will fall. 

-----

Your endless throne, O God,
forever will endure. 
The scepter of your kingdom is
a scepter right and pure.
