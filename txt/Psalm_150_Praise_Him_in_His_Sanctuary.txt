# Psalm 150

Praise Him in His sanctuary,
praise Him in the skies above,
Praise Him for the acts of power
that He does.
Praise Him for surpassing greatness,
with the trumpet, harp and lyre, 
with the tambourine and dancing,
praise Him now.

-----

Come and praise Him,
for the Lord is good,
and His mercy's everlasting.
Come and praise Him,
for the Lord is good,
and His mercy's everlasting.

-----

Praise Him with the clashing cymbals,
let them hear it far and near.
With the strings and flute we'll praise
the Lord our God;
Who with majesty is reigning,
He has power over all.
Give Him glory, and be thankful
for His love.

-----

Come and praise Him,
for the Lord is good,
and His mercy's everlasting.
Come and praise Him,
for the Lord is good,
and His mercy's everlasting.
