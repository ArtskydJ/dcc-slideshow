# He Leadeth Me: O Blessed Thought

He leadeth me: O blessed thought!
O words with heav'nly comfort fraught!
Whate'er I do, where'er I be,
still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

-----

He leadeth me, he leadeth me;
by his own hand he leadeth me:
his faithful foll'wer I would be,
for by his hand he leadeth me.

-----

Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,
sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
by waters calm, o'er troubled sea,
still 'tis his hand that leadeth me.

-----

He leadeth me, he leadeth me;
by his own hand he leadeth me:
his faithful foll'wer I would be,
for by his hand he leadeth me.

-----

Lord, I would clasp thy hand in mine,
nor ever murmur nor repine;
content, whatever lot I see,
since 'tis my God that leadeth me.

-----

He leadeth me, he leadeth me;
by his own hand he leadeth me:
his faithful foll'wer I would be,
for by his hand he leadeth me.

-----

And when my task on earth is done,
when, by thy grace, the vict'ry's won,
e'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
since God through Jordan leadeth me.

-----

# He Leadeth Me: O Blessed Thought 

He leadeth me, he leadeth me;
by his own hand he leadeth me:
his faithful foll'wer I would be,
for by his hand he leadeth me.
