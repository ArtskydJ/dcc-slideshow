# Psalm 67

O God, to us show mercy,
and bless us in thy grace; 
cause thou to shine upon us
the brightness of thy face;

-----

That so thy way most holy
on earth may soon be known,
and unto every people
thy saving grace be shown.

-----

O God, let peoples praise thee;
let all the people sing;
let nations now be joyful;
let songs of gladness ring;

-----

For thou wilt judge the peoples
in truth and righteousness;
and o'er the earth shall nations
thy leadership confess.

-----

O God, let peoples praise thee;
let all the people sing;
for earth in rich abundance
to us her fruit will bring.

-----

God, our own God, will bless us;
yea, God will blessing send;
and all the earth shall fear him
to its remotest end.
