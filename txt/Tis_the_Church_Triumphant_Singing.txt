# 'Tis the Church Triumphant Singing

'Tis the church triumphant singing,
worthy the Lamb!
Heav'n throughout with praises ringing,
worthy the Lamb!

-----

Thrones and pow'rs before Him bending,
odors sweet with voice ascending,
swell the chorus never ending,
worthy the Lamb!

-----

MEN: Every kindred, tongue and nation,
WOMEN: Worthy the Lamb!
MEN: Join to sing the great salvation;
WOMEN: Worthy the Lamb!
ALL: Loud as mighty thunders roaring,
floods of mighty waters pouring,
MEN: Prostrate at His feet adoring,
WOMEN: Worthy the Lamb!

-----

WOMEN: Harps and songs forever sounding,
MEN: Worthy the Lamb!
WOMEN: Mighty grace o'er sin abounding:
MEN: Worthy the Lamb!
ALL: By His blood He dearly bought us,
wandering from the fold He sought us;
WOMEN: And to glory safely brought us:
MEN: Worthy the Lamb!

-----

ALL: Sing with blessed anticipation,
worthy the Lamb!
Through the vale of tribulation,
worthy the Lamb!

-----

Sweetest notes, all notes excelling,
on the theme forever dwelling,
still untold, though ever telling,
worthy the Lamb!
