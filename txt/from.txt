# For this Purpose

For this purpose Christ was reveal'd:
to destroy all the works of the evil one.
Christ in us has overcome
so with gladness we sing
and welcome his kingdom in.

-----

Men: Over sin he has conquer'd,
Women: hallelujah he has conquer'd.
Men: Over death victorious,
Women: hallelujah victorious.
Men: Over sickness he has triumph'd,
Women: hallelujah he has triumph'd.
All: Jesus reigns over all.

-----

In the name of Jesus we stand.
By the power of his blood
we now claim this ground.
Satan has no authority here.
Powers of darkness must flee
for Christ has the victory. 

-----

Men: Over sin he has conquer'd,
Women: hallelujah he has conquer'd.
Men: Over death victorious,
Women: hallelujah victorious.
Men: Over sickness he has triumph'd,
Women: hallelujah he has triumph'd.
All: Jesus reigns over all.
