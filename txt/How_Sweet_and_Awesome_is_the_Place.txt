# How Sweet and Awesome is the Place

How sweet and awesome is the place
with Christ within the doors, 
while everlasting love displays
the choicest of her stores. 

-----

While all our hearts and all our songs
join to admire the feast, 
each of us cries, with thankful tongue,
"Lord, why was I a guest?"

-----

"Why was I made to hear your voice,
and enter while there's room, 
when thousands make a wretched choice,
and rather starve than come?" 

-----

'Twas the same love that spread the feast
that sweetly drew us in; 
else we had still refused to taste,
and perished in our sin. 

-----

Pity the nations, O our God,
constrain the earth to come; 
send your victorious Word abroad,
and bring the strangers home. 

-----

We long to see your churches full,
that all the chosen race 
May, with one voice and heart and soul,
sing your redeeming grace.
