# Be Known to Us

Be known to us in breaking bread,
But do not then depart;
Savior, abide with us, and spread
Thy table in our heart.

-----

There sup with us in love divine;
Thy body and Thy blood,
That living bread, that heav'nly wine,
Be our immortal food.

-----

We would not live by bread alone,
but by Thy word of grace, 
in strength of which we travel on
to our abiding place.
