# Your Mercy Flows (Ps. 46:4; 85:4-7)

Your mercy flows
upon us like a river. 
Your mercy stands
unshakable and true.
Most holy God,
of all good things the giver, 
we turn and lift
our fervent prayer to you. 

-----

Men (Women echo):
Hear our cry, O LORD,
be merciful once more. 
Let Your love Your anger stem, 
All: remember mercy, O LORD, again.

-----

Your church once great,
though standing clothed in sorrow, 
is even still
the bride that You adore.
Revive your church,
that we again may honor 
our God and King,
our Master and our Lord.

-----

Men (Women echo):
Hear our cry, O LORD,
be merciful once more. 
Let Your love Your anger stem, 
All: remember mercy, O LORD, again.

-----

As we have slept,
this nation has been taken 
by every sin,
ever known to man.
So at its gates,
though burnt by fire and broken, 
in Jesus' name
we come to take our stand.

-----

Men (Women echo):
Hear our cry, O LORD,
be merciful once more. 
Let Your love Your anger stem, 
All: remember mercy, O LORD, again.
