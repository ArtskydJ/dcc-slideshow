# Arise My Soul, Arise

Arise, my soul, arise,
shake off your guilty fears; 
the bleeding Sacrifice
on my behalf appears: 
before the throne my Surety stands,
before the throne my Surety stands, 
my name is written on His hands. 

-----

Arise! (Arise!) Arise! (Arise!) 
Arise, arise, my soul, arise!
Arise! (Arise!) Arise! (Arise!) 
Arise, arise, my soul, arise! 
Shake off your guilty fears and rise!

He ever lives above,
for me to intercede, 
His all redeeming love,
His precious blood to plead. 
His blood atoned for ev'ry race,
His blood atoned for ev'ry race, 
and sprinkles now the throne of grace. 

-----

Arise! (Arise!) Arise! (Arise!) 
Arise, arise, my soul, arise!
Arise! (Arise!) Arise! (Arise!) 
Arise, arise, my soul, arise! 
Shake off your guilty fears and rise!

Five bleeding wounds He bears,
received on Calvary; 
they pour effectual prayers,
they strongly plead for me. 
"Forgive him, O forgive," they cry,
"forgive him, O forgive," they cry, 
"don't let that ransomed sinner die!" 

-----

Arise! (Arise!) Arise! (Arise!) 
Arise, arise, my soul, arise!
Arise! (Arise!) Arise! (Arise!) 
Arise, arise, my soul, arise! 
Shake off your guilty fears and rise! 

-----

My God is reconciled;
His pardoning voice I hear; 
He owns me for His child,
I can no longer fear; 
with confidence I now draw nigh,
with confidence I now draw nigh, 
and "Father, Abba, Father!" cry.

-----

Arise! (Arise!) Arise! (Arise!) 
Arise, arise, my soul, arise!
Arise! (Arise!) Arise! (Arise!) 
Arise, arise, my soul, arise! 
Shake off your guilty fears and rise!

-----

Arise! (Arise!) Arise! (Arise!) 
Arise, arise, my soul, arise!
Arise! (Arise!) Arise! (Arise!) 
Arise, arise, my soul, arise! 
Shake off your guilty fears and rise!
