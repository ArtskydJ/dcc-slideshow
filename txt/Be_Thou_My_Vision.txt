# Be Thou My Vision

Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;
naught be all else to me, save that Thou art. 
Thou my best thought by day or by night,
waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light. 

-----

Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord. 
Thou my great Father; I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one. 

-----

Be Thou my battle shield, sword for my fight;
be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight. 
Thou my soul's shelter, Thou my high tow'r,
raise Thou me heav'n-ward, O Pow'r of my pow'r.

-----

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise;
Thou mine inheritance, now and always: 
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

-----

High King of heaven, my victory won,
may I reach heaven's joys, O bright heav'n's Son! 
Heart of my own heart, whatever be fall,
still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
