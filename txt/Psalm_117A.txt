# Psalm 117A

O all you nations of the earth
Give praises to the LORD;
And all you peoples magnify
His name with one accord,
His name with one accord.

-----

Because His love for us is strong
His lovingkindnesses,
The Lord is faithful evermore;
Praise to the Lord express!
Praise to the Lord express!
