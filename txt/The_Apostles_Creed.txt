# The Apostles Creed

All:I believe in God, the Father almighty,
Maker of heaven and earth,
 and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; He descended into Hades. The third day He rose again from the dead; 

-----

 He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from there He shall come to judge the living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit; the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen
