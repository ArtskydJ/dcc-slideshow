# Psalm 39 (I Said, "I Will Keep Watch")

I said, I will keep watch and guard my ways,
And I will keep my tongue from sinful stain.
As with a bridle I will keep my mouth,
While in my presence wicked men remain."

-----

Silent, I ceased from speaking even good;
My heart within was hot, my sorrow stirred,
And while I mused a fire began to burn;
Then with my tongue, I spoke this earnest word:

-----

"Lord, make me know my end, my numbered days;
And let me know how fleeting is my life;
For you have made my days a hand-breadth long;
My lifetime is as nothing in your sight.

-----

Each man at best is but a fleeting breath.
Man, like a shadow, wanders to and fro;
Surely an uproar he creates in vain;
He never knows to whom his riches go."
