# Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
ye soldiers of the cross;
Lift high his royal banner,
it must not suffer loss.
From victory unto victory
His army shall he lead,
Till every foe is vanquished,
and Christ is Lord indeed.

-----

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
the trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict,
in this his glorious day.
Ye that are men now serve him
against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger,
and strength to strength oppose.

-----

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
stand in his strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you,
ye dare not trust your own.
Put on the Gospel armor,
each piece put on with prayer;
Where duty calls or danger,
be never wanting there.

-----

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
the strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle,
the next the victor's song.
To him that overcometh
a crown of life shall be;
he with the King of Glory
shall reign eternally.
