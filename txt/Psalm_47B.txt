All nations clap your hands and shout;
to God with joyful voices sing!
For awesome is the Lord Most High,
who over all the earth is King.

-----

He has subdued beneath our feet
the nations who were once our foes.
And Jacob's glory, whom He loves,
we now inherit as He chose.

-----

God has ascended with a shout!
The Lord amidst the trumpet's ring.
Sing praise! Sing praises unto God!
Sing praise! Sing praises to our King!

-----

For God is King of all the earth;
Sing praises with a skillful tone.
God rules the nations from on high;
God sits upon His holy throne.

-----

Leaders of nations join themselves,
as those of Abr'ham's God they come,
because earth's shields belong to God;
He is the great exalted one.
