# My Life is In You

My life is in you, Lord;
my strength is in you, Lord;
my hope is in you, Lord,
in you, it's in you. 

-----

My Lord and my Savior,
my Rock and Deliv'rer,
the Alpha, Omega,
all life is in You. 

-----

My life is in You, Lord;
my strength is in You, Lord;
my hope is in You, Lord,
in You, it's in You. 

-----

Though weakness besets us
and hosts come against us
in this we are certain
our strength is in You. 

-----

I will praise You with all of my life;
I will praise You with all of my strength,
with all of my life, with all of my strength. 
All of my hope is in You!

-----

Your grace is sufficient,
Your mercy abounding,
salvation is certain in You, it's in You. 

-----

My Lord and my Savior,
my Rock and Deliv'rer,
the Alpha, Omega
all life is in You,
it's only in You, in You,
it's in You, in You!
