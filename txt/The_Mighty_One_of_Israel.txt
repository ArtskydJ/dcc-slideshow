# The Mighty One of Israel

The Lord shall cause
his glorious voice to be heard,
and you shall have a song in the night;
come to the mountain of the Lord,
see his glory and his might.

-----

He's the Mighty One of Israel,
the Mighty One of Israel. 
His voice shall be heard
in the power of his Word; 
The Mighty One of Israel.

-----

The eyes of the blind
shall be opened and they'll see,
the ears of the deaf shall hear,
the lame man shall jump
and shall leap as a hart,
the tongue of the dumb shall sing.

-----

He's the Mighty One of Israel,
the Mighty One of Israel. 
His voice shall be heard
in the power of his Word; 
The Mighty One of Israel.

-----

The Lord shall cause
his glorious beauty to be seen,
the desert shall bloom and rejoice; 
say to them that are fearful of heart,
be strong and listen to his voice.

-----

He's the Mighty One of Israel,
the Mighty One of Israel. 
His voice shall be heard
in the power of his Word; 
The Mighty One of Israel.

-----

He's the Mighty One of Israel,
the Mighty One of Israel. 
His voice shall be heard
in the power of his Word; 
The Mighty One of Israel.
The Mighty One of Israel.
 The Mighty One of Israel.
