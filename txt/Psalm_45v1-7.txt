# Psalm 45.1-7

My heart is greatly stirred,
I sing a noble theme;
my tongue's a skillful writer's pen
to speak about the King.
Most beautiful of men,
your lips are full of grace;
and therefore God bestowed on you
a blessing evermore.

-----

O Warrior, take your sword in splendid majesty!
For meekness, truth, and righteousness ride on in victory.
Your right hand makes you feared. How sharp your arrows are;
they pierce the King's foes to the heart. Beneath you nations fall.

-----

Your throne, O God, will last forever, evermore. 
The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter that is just.
For you loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
above all others, God, your God anointed you with joy.
