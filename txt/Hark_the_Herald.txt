# Hark, the Herald

Hark the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King!
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled."

-----

Joyful, all ye nations rise
join the triumph of the skies;
with the angelic host proclaim: 
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King!"

-----

Christ by highest heav'n adored,
Christ the everlasting Lord!
Late in time behold him come
offspring of a virgin's womb.

-----

Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,
hail the incarnate Deity;
pleased as man with men to dwell,
Jesus, our Immanuel.
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King!"

-----

Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace! 
Hail the Son of Righteousness!
Light and life to all he brings
ris'n with healing in his wings.

-----

Mild he lays his glory by
born that man no more may die;
born to raise the sons of earth,
born to give them second birth.
Hark! The herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King!"

-----

Come Desire of nations come,
fix us in thy humble home; 
rise the woman's conqu'ring seed,
 bruise in us the serpent's head.

-----

Now display thy saving power,
ruined nature now restore;
now in mystic union join
thine to ours, and ours to thine. 
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King!"

-----

Adam's likeness, Lord, efface,
stamp thine image in its place:
second Adam from above,
reinstate us in thy love.

-----

Let us thee, though lost, regain,
thee, the Life, the inner man:
O, to all thyself impart,
formed in each believing heart.
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King!"
