# Angels from the Realms of Glory

Angels from the realms of glory,
wing your flight o'er all the earth;
Ye who sang creation's story
now proclaim Messiah's birth.
Come and worship, come and worship,
worship Christ, the newborn King.

-----

Shepherds, in the field abiding,
watching o'er your flocks by night,
God with us is now residing;
yonder shines the infant light:
Come and worship, come and worship,
worship Christ, the newborn King.

-----

Sages, leave your contemplations,
brighter visions beam afar;
Seek the great Desire of nations;
ye have seen His natal star.
Come and worship, come and worship,
worship Christ, the newborn King.

-----

Saints, before the altar bending,
watching long in hope and fear;
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
in His temple shall appear.
Come and worship, come and worship,
worship Christ, the newborn King.

-----

All creation, join in praising
God, the Father, Spirit, Son,
Evermore your voices raising
to th'eternal Three in One.
Come and worship, come and worship,
worship Christ, the newborn King.
