O come, all ye faithful,
joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
come and behold him
born the King of angels!

O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord!

Sing, choirs of angels;
sing in exultation,
sing, all ye citizens of heav'n above;
glory to God, all
glory in the highest!

O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord!

# He is Exalted 

He is exalted, the King is exalted on high,
I will praise him.
He is exalted, forever exalted
and I will praise his name.

-----

He is the Lord,
forever his truth shall reign. 
Heaven and earth
rejoice in his holy name.
He is exalted,
the King is exalted on high.

# O Come All Ye Faithful

Yea, Lord, we greet thee,
born that happy morning:
Jesus, to thee be all glory giv'n:
Word of the Father,
late in flesh appearing!

-----

O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord!
