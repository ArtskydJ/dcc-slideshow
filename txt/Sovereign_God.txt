# Sovereign God

Sov'reign God,
you redeemed me by your blood; 
I will serve no other gods
for your nearness is my good.

-----

Sov'reign God,
you're the one I will adore,
I'm so grateful just to know you,
and to worship in your courts.

-----

My glory and the one who lifts my head,
I rejoice in you. 
My glory and the one who lifts my head,
I will say to you, 
How awesome are your works,
you're the hope of the ends of the earth. 
My glory and the one who lifts my head.

-----

Father God,
there is one thing I desire, 
to behold your beauty, Lord
and to dwell within your house.

-----

Abba God,
hide us in the secret place. 
You alone are my desire
and I seek your presence Lord.

-----

My glory and the one who lifts my head,
I rejoice in you. 
My glory and the one who lifts my head,
I will say to you, 
How awesome are your works,
you're the hope of the ends of the earth. 
My glory and the one who lifts my head.

-----

My glory and the one who lifts my head,
I rejoice in you. 
My glory and the one who lifts my head,
I will say to you, 
How awesome are your works,
you're the hope of the ends of the earth. 
My glory and the one who lifts my head.
