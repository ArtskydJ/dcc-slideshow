# Psalm 47

All nations, clap your hands for joy;
to God lift shouts and sing!
For awesome is the Lord most high,
above all earth great king!
He brings the peoples under us,
with mastery complete;
And He it is who nations all
subdues beneath our feet.

-----

The land of our inheritance
He chooses out for us, 
and He to us the glory gives
of Jacob whom He loves. 
God has ascended with a shout,
the Lord with trumpeting. 
Sing praise to God, sing praise, sing praise,
sing praises to our King.

-----

For God is king of all the earth;
sing praise with skillfulness. 
God rules the nations, God sits on
His throne of holiness. 
The princes of the peoples join
as men of Abrahams's God. 
The shields to earth belong to Him;
exalted high is God.
