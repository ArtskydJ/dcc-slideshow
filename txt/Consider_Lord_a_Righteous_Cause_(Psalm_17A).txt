# Consider Lord, a Righteous Cause (Psalm 17)

Consider Lord, a righteous cause;
o listen to my cry!
Give Your attention to my prayer,
for my lips to not lie.
Let justice from Your presence come
by vindicating me;
So let Your eyes see everything
with perfect equity.

-----

You came by night and tested me,
You searched my heart within;
You probed and found no wrong intent,
I'll keep my mouth from sin.
I'm kept from violence by the word
as spoken from Your lips.
My foot I've kept upon Your path,
and so it never slips.

-----

On You, o God, my soul has called,
For You will answer me.
O listen to my earnest words!
Incline Your ear to me!
In wondrous and amazing ways
Your lovingkindness show;
Your right hand saves those trusting You,
to hide them from the foe

-----

Keep me the focus of Your eye;
beneath Your wings me hide
From wicked men and deadly foes
Who press on every side.
These men have closed their hardened hearts;
Their boastful words abound.
Surrounding us, they closely watch
to cast us to the ground.

-----

My foe is like a lion strong
that craves to tear his prey;
A lion young prepared to pounce
He lurks along the way.
Arise, O Lord. Confront my foe.
O bring him very low!
O save my soul from wicked men!
Let them feel Your sword's blow.

-----

Save me by Your own hand, o Lord,
from worldly men of earth,
Who only in this present life
Know anything of worth.
You filled them with the wealth You stored,
Their children satisfied;
So they may leave enough behind
their young ones to provide.

-----

But as for me, with righteousness
shall I behold Your face.
I shall be satisfied to wake
and see You face to face.
