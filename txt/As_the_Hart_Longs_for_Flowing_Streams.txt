# As the Hart Longs for Flowing Streams

As the hart longs
for flowing streams, 
so longs my soul
for Thee, O God.
My soul does thirst
for the living God; 
when shall I come
to see Thy face?

-----

My tears have fed
me day and night, 
while men have said,
"Where is your God?"
But I recall
as my soul pours dry, 
the days of praise
within Thy house.

-----

Why do I mourn
and toil within,
when it is mine
to hope in God?
I shall again,
sing praise to him;
He is my help, 
He is my God.
