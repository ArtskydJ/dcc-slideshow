# Psalm 84

How lovely Lord of hosts, to me
the tabernacles of Thy grace!
O how I long, yes, faint to see
the Lord's own courts, His dwelling place!
My heart and flesh with joy draw nigh
as to the living God I cry.

-----

The sparrow has her place of rest;
the swallow throughTthy kindly care
has found where she may build her nest
and brood her young in safety there.
Your altars as my rest I sing,
O Lord of hosts, my God, my King.

-----

Blest they who in Your house abide;
to You they ever render praise.
Blest they who in Thy strength confide,
and in whose heart are pilgrims' ways.
They make the vale of tears a spring,
with showers of blessings covering.

-----

Advancing still from strength to strength
they go where other pilgrims trod,
till each to Zion comes at length
and stands before the face of God.
Lord God of hosts, my pleading hear;
O Jacob's God, to me give ear.

-----

And look, O God, upon our Shield;
the face of Your anointed view; 
one day within Your courts will yield
more good than thousands without You.
I'd rather stand near my God's house
than dwell in tents of wickedness.

-----

For God the Lord is shield and sun;
the Lord will grace and glory give. 
No good will He withhold from one
who does uprightly walk and live.
O Lord of hosts, that one is blest 
who makes His trust upon you rest!
