# Awesome Power

Awesome power, boundless grace;
None can fathom all your ways.
Truth and love are found in your heart alone;
Righteousness surrounds your throne.
Holy, holy, holy Lord most high;
Holy, holy, holy Lord most high.

# We Come O Christ to You

We come, O Christ, to you,
true Son of God and man,
By whom all things consist,
in whom all life began:
In you alone
we live and move, and have our being
in your love.

-----

You are the Way to God,
your blood our ransom paid;
In you we face our Judge and Maker unafraid.
Before the throne
absolved we stand,
your love has met your law's demand.

-----

You are the living Truth! 
All wisdom dwells in you,
the Source of every skill,
the One eternal TRUE!
O great I AM! 
In you we rest,
sure answer to our every quest.

Holy, holy, holy Lord most high;
Holy, holy, holy Lord most high.

# We Come O Christ to You

You only are true Life,
to know you is to live
the more abundant life
that earth can never give:
O risen Lord! 
We live in you; in us each day
your life renew!

-----

We worship you, Lord Christ,
our Savior and our King,
To you our youth and strength
adoringly we bring;
So fill our hearts,
that all may view your life in us,
and turn to you.
