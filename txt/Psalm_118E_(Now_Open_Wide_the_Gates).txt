# Psalm 118E (Now Open Wide the Gates)

Now open wide the gates for me.
The gates of righteousness, 
And I will enter in through them;
With thanks the LORD I'll bless. 
This is the gate that is the LORDS's The righteous enter in. I'm thankful You have answered me; My Savior You have been

That stone is now the cornerstone That builders once despised. 
This is the doing of the LORD, And wondrous in our eyes. 
This is the day the LORD has made; Let us be glad and sing, Hosanna, LORD! O give success! O LORD, salvation bring!

-----

O Blessed is the one who comes, Comes in the LORD's great name. A blessing from the LORD's own house Upon you we proclaim. 
The LORD is God and He to us Has made the light arise. With cords bind to the altar's horns The festal sacrifice.

-----

You are my God, I'll give You thanks; My God, I'll give you praise. 
O thank the Lord, for He is good; His love lasts endless days.
