# Psalm 60B

God in His holiness declared, "I will exult and shout, 
The land of Shechem I'll divide And
Succoth portion out. 
The land of Gilead is Mine, Manasseh, too, I own; My head's defense is Ephraim, 
And Judah is My throne."

-----

I made My wash-bowl Moab's land, 
on Edom threw My shoe; So shout aloud, Philistia, Because of what I do." 
O who is there to bring me to The city fortified? And who is there to lead me on To Edom as a 
guide?

-----

But have not Your Yourself, o God, Rejected us once more? And will You not stand up, 
O God, To go with us to war? Give help against the enemy, 
No help does man bestow. With God we will do valiantly; He tramples down our foes.
