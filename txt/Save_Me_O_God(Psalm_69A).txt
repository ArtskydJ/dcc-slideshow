# Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence

Let all mortal flesh keep silence,
 And with fear and trembling stand;
Set your minds on things eternal,
 For with blessing in His hand,
Christ our God to earth descendeth,
 Our full homage to demand.

-----

King of kings, yet born of Mary,
 once upon the earth he stood;
Lord of lords we now perceive him,
 In the body and the blood;
He will give to all the faithful
 His own self for heavenly food.

-----

Rank on rank the host of heaven
 Stream before him on the way,
As the Light of light descendeth
 From the realms of endless day,
That the powers of hell may vanish
 Clears the gloom of Hell away.

-----

At His feet the six wingÃ¨d seraph,
 Cherubim with sleepless eye,
Veil their faces to his presence,
 As with ceaseless voice they cry,
Alleluia, Alleluia
Alleluia, Lord Most High!
