# Isaiah 62:1-3 (For Zion's Sake) 

For Zion's sake I will not keep silent,
for Jer-u-sa-lem I will not keep quiet,
till her righteousness goes forth like brightness,
like a flaming torch her salvation. 

-----

You will be a crown of beauty
in the hand of the Lord,
you will be a royal diadem
in the hand of your God. 

-----

The nations will see your righteousness,
and all kings will see your glory,
and you will be called by a new name
which the mouth of the Lord will choose. 

-----

You will be a crown of beauty
in the hand of the Lord,
you will be a royal diadem
in the hand of your God. 

-----

So take no rest for yourselves,
all you who remind the Lord,
and give him no rest until he makes
Je-ru-sa-lem a praise in the earth. 

-----

You will be a crown of beauty
in the hand of the Lord,
you will be a royal diadem
in the hand of your God. 

-----

For Zion's sake I will not keep silent,
for Jer-u-sa-lem I will not keep quiet,
till her righteousness goes forth like brightness,
like a flaming torch her salvation.
