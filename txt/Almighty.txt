# Almighty

Almighty, most holy God,
faithful through the ages; 
Almighty, most holy Lord,
glorious, Almighty God. 

-----

The beasts of the field,
the birds of the air,
are silent to call out Your name. 
The earth has no voice,
and I have no choice
but to magnify God unashamed. 

-----

Let the rocks be kept silent
for one more day; 
let the whole world sing out,
let the people say.

-----

Almighty, most holy God,
faithful through the ages; 
Almighty, most holy Lord,
glorious, Almighty God. 

-----

When time marches on,
with the innocence gone,
and a darkness has covered the earth; 
but His Spirit dwells;
He speaks, "It is well,"
and the hopeless still offered new birth. 

-----

He will break the leash of death,
it will have no sting; 
let the pris'ner go free,
join the dance and sing.

-----

Almighty, most holy God,
faithful through the ages; 
Almighty, most holy Lord,
glorious, Almighty God. 

-----

Almighty, most holy God,
faithful through the ages; 
Almighty, most holy Lord,
glorious, Almighty God.
