# Psalm 6

Lord, in thy wrath rebuke me not;
nor in thy hot rage chasten me. 
Lord, pity me, for I am weak:
Heal me, for my bones vexed be.
My soul is also vexed sore;
but, Lord, how long stay wilt thou make?
Return, O Lord, my soul set free;
O save me, for thy mercies' sake.

Because those that deceased are
of thee shall no remembrance have;
And who is he that will to thee
give praises lying in the grave?
I with my groaning weary am,
I also all the night my bed
Have caused for to swim;
and I with tears my couch have watered.

-----

Mine eye, consum'd with grief,
grows old, Because of all mine enemies.
Hence from me, wicked workers all;
For God hath heard my weeping cries.
God hath my supplication heard,
my pray'r received graciously.
Sham'd and sore vex'd be all my foes,
sham'd and back turned suddenly.

# Deuteronomy 32.4, 30-31

How could one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Unless their Rock had sold them, And the LORD had surrendered them? For their rock is not like our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges.
