# Fear Not, O Little Flock

Fear not, O little flock, the foe
who madly seeks your overthrow;
dread not his rage and power;
what though your courage sometimes faints, his seeming triumph o'er God's saints
lasts but a little hour.

-----

Be of good cheer; your cause belongs
to Him who can avenge your wrongs;
leave it to him our Lord;
though hidden yet from all our eyes,
he sees the Gideon who shall rise;
to save us, and his Word.

-----

As true as God's own Word is true,
nor earth nor hell with all their crew
against us shall prevail.
A jest and by-word are they grown;
God is with us, we are his own;
our victory cannot fail.

-----

Amen, Lord Jesus, grant our pray'r;
great Captain, now your arm make bare,
fight for us once again;
so shall your saints and martyrs raise
a mighty chorus to your praise,
world without end. Amen.
