# All People That on Earth Do Dwell (Psalm 100)

All people that on earth do dwell,
sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
Him serve with fear, His praise forth tell, come ye before Him and rejoice.

-----

The Lord, ye know, is God indeed;
without our aid He did us make;
we are His folk, He doth us feed,
and for His sheep He doth us take.

-----

O enter then His gates with praise,
approach with joy His courts unto;
praise, laud, and bless His Name always, for it is seemly so to do.

-----

For why? The Lord our God is good;
His mercy is for ever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
and shall from age to age endure.
