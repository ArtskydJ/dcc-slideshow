# Psalm 133

Behold how good a thing it is,
And how becoming well,
When those that brethren are, delight
in unity to dwell.

-----

For it is like the precious oil
poured out on Aaron's head,
That going down upon his beard,
upon his garments spread..

-----

Like Hermon's dew upon the hills
of Zion that descends,
The Lord commands His blessing there, 
Ev'n life that never ends.
