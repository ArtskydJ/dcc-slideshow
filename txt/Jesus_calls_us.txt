# Jesus Calls Us 

Jesus calls us over the tumult
of our life's wild, restless, sea;
day by day his sweet voice soundeth,
saying, "Christian, follow me!"

-----

As of old apostles heard it
by the Galilean lake,
turned from home and toil and kindred,
leaving all for Jesus' sake.

-----

Jesus calls us from the worship
of the vain world's golden store,
from each idol that would keep us,
saying, "Christian, love me more!"

-----

In our joys and in our sorrows,
days of toil and hours of ease,
still he calls, in cares and pleasures,
"Christian, love me more than these!"

-----

Jesus calls us! by thy mercies,
Savior may we hear thy call,
give our hearts to thine obedience,
serve and love thee best of all.
