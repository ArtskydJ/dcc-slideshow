# My Soul Waits - Psalm 62

My soul waits in expectation,
and depends on God indeed. 
All my strength and my salvation,
does from Him alone proceed. 
He alone is my Salvation,
He alone my sure defense; 
He alone my sure defense.

-----

In my God I rest and glory,
for salvation is most sure.
In the God and Rock of strength,
is my refuge most secure.
I shall not be greatly shaken,
from my Stronghold and Defense;
From my Stronghold and Defense.

-----

All you peoples, all you nations,
all times place in Him your trust!
Pour out all your heart before Him,
trust in nothing but His love.
God is a refuge for His people.
Power belongs to God alone!
Power belongs to God alone.
