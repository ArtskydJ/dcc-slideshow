Blessed be the Lord our God
to all eternity. 
The whole earth let his glory fill.
Amen, so let it be. 

-----

And we cry glory, glory, glory;
and we cry glory, glory, glory; 
and we cry glory, glory, glory
to the Lord. 

-----

Great King of nations
hear our prayer, 
while at your feet we fall,
and humbly with
united cry
to You for mercy call. 

-----

And we cry mercy, mercy, mercy;
and we cry mercy, mercy, mercy; 
and we cry mercy, mercy, mercy
from the Lord. 

-----

We fall down,
we lay our crowns
at the feet of Jesus, 
the greatness of
His mercy and love,
at the feet of Jesus. 

-----

And we cry holy, holy, holy;
and we cry holy, holy, holy; 
and we cry holy, holy, holy
is the Lamb. 

-----

And we cry holy, holy, holy;
and we cry holy, holy, holy; 
and we cry holy, holy, holy
is the Lamb. 
Holy, holy, holy is the Lamb.
