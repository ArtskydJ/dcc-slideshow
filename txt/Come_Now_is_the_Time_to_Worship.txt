# Come, Now is the Time To Worship

Come, now is the time to worship.
Come, now is the time to give your heart.
Come, cleansed in His blood to worship.
Come, clothed in the righteous robes of Christ. Come… 

-----

One day every tongue will confess You are God,
one day every knee will bow. 
Still the greatest treasure remains for those
who gladly choose You now.

-----

Come, come with the saints to Zion;
come, come to the city of our God. 
Come, come with the hosts of angels;
come, into the temple of the heav'ns. 
Come…

-----

For boldly through His grace we may come to His throne,
sprinkled by the blood of the Lamb; 
entering the vict'ry that belongs to Christ,
Our Savior, Judge and King. 

-----

One day every tongue will confess You are God, one day every knee will bow. 
Still the greatest treasure remains for those
who gladly choose You now. 

-----

Come, now is the time to worship;
come, now is the time to give your heart. 
Come, cleansed in His blood to worship.
Come, clothed in the righteous robes of Christ. 
Come, now is the time to come,
now is the time to worship.
