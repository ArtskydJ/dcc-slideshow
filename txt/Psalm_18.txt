# Psalm 18

How I love you, Lord, my God,
you, my rock and fortress strong; 
constant refuge, mighty shield;
I will praise you in my song.

-----

Snares of death entangled me,
hellish torrents frightened me; 
but you heard my desperate cry,
and your hand has set me free. 

-----

All creation reeled and rocked,
mountains quaked when God came down,
soaring on the wings of wind,
fire and hailstones all around.

-----

Then his nostrils, with a blast,
split the sea that billowed there; 
when the Lord unleashed his wrath,
earth's foundations were laid bare.

-----

From on high the Lord reached down,
seized me with his powerful arm; 
when the floods engulfed my soul,
he delivered me from harm.

-----

God the Lord, my strong support,
brought me to a spacious place, 
for it is his great delight
to reward my righteous ways.

-----

With the faithful you are true,
to the pure you show your grace, 
but to crooked human-kind
you reveal an angry face. 

-----

You, Lord, bring the haughty low,
save the humble from their plight, 
and you keep my lamp aglow,
turn my darkness into light.

-----

All God's promises are sure.
Who is God besides the Lord? 
He is perfect in his ways.
Who's the Rock except our God?

-----

It is God who gives me strength;
he enables me to stand 
high above the battlefield,
held up by his powerful hand.

-----

God prepares me well for war,
makes my feet as swift as deer, 
arms me with salvation's shield,
makes my pathway broad and sure.

-----

I pursued my enemies
till they fell beneath my feet, 
beat them fine like blowing dust,
low like dirt that lines the street.  

-----

God has rescued me from strife
with the nations all around. 
He has made me head of all;
foreign leaders now bow down.

-----

Yes, the Lord exalted me
over all my enemies; 
they obey all my commands,
cringing low on trembling knees.

-----

God the Lord, my Savior, lives!
To my Rock be all the praise! 
He has overcome my foes,
shown me his unfailing grace.

-----

Lord, I will extol your name
and make all your blessings known. 
You give vict'ry to your king,
give his heirs a royal throne.
