# Psalm 91 (Incarnate God)

Incarnate God! The soul that knows
Your Name's mysterious pow'r,
will dwell in undisturbed repose
nor fear the trying hour.

-----

Your wisdom, faithfulness, and love
to feeble, frail and worn,
A shelter and a refuge prove
 from enemy and storm.

-----

In vain the fowler spreads his net
to draw them from Your care;
Your timely call instructs their feet
to shun the artful snare.

-----

When, like a baneful pestilence,
sin mows its thousands down,
On every side without defense
His grace secures His own.

-----

No midnight terrors haunt their bed,
No arrow wounds by day; 
Unhurt on serpents they shall tread,
if found in duty's way. 

-----

Angels, unseen, attend the saints
and bear them in their arms, 
To cheer the spirit when it faints,
 and guard their life from harms.

-----

The angels' Lord Himself is nigh
to them that love His Name; 
Is quick to save them when they cry,
and put their foes to shame. 

-----

The Lord will answer when they call
long as they sojourn here,
Because the Lord is their defense
what have the saints to fear?
