Jesus! what a Friend for sinners! 
Jesus! lover of my soul;
friends may fail me, foes assail me,
he, my Savior, makes me whole.

Hallelujah! what a Friend!

Jesus! what a strength in weakness!
Let me hide myself in him;
tempted, tried, and sometimes failing,
he, my strength, my vict'ry wins. 
Hallelujah! what a Savior! 
Hallelujah! what a Friend!

While the billows o'er me roll,
even when my heart is breaking,
he, my comfort, helps my soul. 
Hallelujah! what a Savior! 
Hallelujah! what a Friend!

Jesus! what a guide and keeper! 
While the tempest still is high;
storms about me, night o'er-takes me,
he, my pilot, hears my cry. 
Hallelujah! what a Savior! 
Hallelujah! what a Friend!
Saving, helping, keeping, loving,
he is with me to the end.

Jesus! I do now receive you,
more than all in you I find;
you hath granted me forgiveness,
I am yours, and you are mine. 
Hallelujah! what a Savior! 
Hallelujah! what a Friend!
Saving, helping, keeping, loving,
you are with me to the end.
