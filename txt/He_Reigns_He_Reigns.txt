# He Reigns He Reigns

He reigns, He reigns, Jesus reigns,
He reigns enthroned in majesty.
Shout your praise, His banners raise,
for Jesus reigns.
Shout hosanna, Jesus reigns.

-----

Our highest praise we bring
to our great eternal King.
His glory fills the skies,
now from earth let praise arise.

-----

He spoiled the hosts of hell,
and like blazing stars, they fell.
He led them forth in chains,
now our mighty Victor reigns!

-----

He reigns, He reigns, Jesus reigns,
He reigns enthroned in majesty.
Shout your praise, His banners raise,
for Jesus reigns.
Shout hosanna, Jesus reigns.

-----

Consuming flames deploy
before Him, to destroy
His foemen round about
who vainly seek to flout.

-----

His lightning bolts when hurled,
enlightened all the world;
earth saw and quaked with fear,
to see His wrath appear.

-----

He reigns, He reigns, Jesus reigns,
He reigns enthroned in majesty.
Shout your praise, His banners raise,
for Jesus reigns.
Shout hosanna, Jesus reigns.

-----

The hills, as wax by fire,
are molten at His ire,
for God as Judge and King,
does awful judgments bring.

-----

The heav'ns in awe express
His perfect righteousness.
Let all the nations see
His glorious majesty.

-----

He reigns, He reigns, Jesus reigns,
He reigns enthroned in majesty.
Shout your praise, His banners raise,
for Jesus reigns.
Shout hosanna, Jesus reigns.

-----

Confounded be all they
who in their folly pray
to gods of man's design
and boast to be divine.

-----

Jehovah, Him we laud,
for He alone is God.
Come, all ye gods, draw near,
and worship Him with fear.

-----

He reigns, He reigns, Jesus reigns,
He reigns enthroned in majesty.
Shout your praise, His banners raise,
for Jesus reigns.
Shout hosanna, Jesus reigns.

-----

He reigns, He reigns, Jesus reigns,
He reigns enthroned in majesty.
Shout your praise, His banners raise,
for Jesus reigns.
Shout hosanna, Jesus reigns.
