# The Power of the Cross 

Oh to see the dawn of the darkest day;
Christ on the road to Calvary. 
Tried by sinful men,
torn and beaten then 
nailed to a cross of wood.

-----

This the power of the cross:
Christ became sin for us, 
took the blame,
bore the wrath
we stand forgiven at the cross.

-----

Oh to see the pain
written on your face, 
bearing the awesome weight of sin.
Ev'ry bitter thought,
ev'ry evil deed 
crowning your bloodstained brow.
 

-----

This the power of the cross:
Christ became sin for us, 
took the blame,
bore the wrath
we stand forgiven at the cross.

-----

Now the daylight flees,
now the ground beneath 
quakes as it's Maker bows his head.
Curtain torn in two; 
dead are raised to life;
"Finished!" the vict'ry cry.

-----

This the power of the cross:
Christ became sin for us, 
took the blame,
bore the wrath
we stand forgiven at the cross.

-----

Oh to see my name
written in the wounds, 
for through your suff'ring I am free.
Death is crushed to death;
life is mine to live,
won through your selfless love.

-----

This the power of the cross:
Christ became sin for us, 
took the blame,
bore the wrath
we stand forgiven at the cross.
