# Bless the Lord (10,000 Reasons)

Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul;
worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, O my soul;
I'll worship Your holy name.

-----

The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning,
it's time to sing Your song again.
Whatever may pass, 
and whatever lies before me,
let me be singing when the evening comes.

-----

Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul;
worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, O my soul;
I'll worship Your holy name.

-----

You're rich in love and You're slow to anger.
Your name is great and Your heart is kind.
For all Your goodness I will keep on singing,
ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.

-----

Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul;
worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, O my soul;
I'll worship Your holy name.

-----

And on that day, when my strength is failing,
the end draws near, and my time has come;
Still my soul will sing Your praise unending,
ten thousand years and then forevermore.

-----

Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul;
worship His holy name.
Sing like never before, O my soul;
I'll worship Your holy name.
Lord I'll worship Your holy name.
Lord I'll worship Your holy name.
