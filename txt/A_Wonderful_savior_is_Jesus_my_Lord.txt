# A Wonderful Savior Is Jesus My Lord 

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, a Wonderful Savior to Me; he holdeth me up,
and I shall not be moved, he giveth my soul in the cleft of the rock, where rivers of 
pleasure I see.
 

-----

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock that shadows a dry, thirsty land he hideth my 
life in the depths of his love, and covers me there with his hand, and covers me there 
with his hand.

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, he taketh my burden away; he holdeth me up, 
and I shall not be moved, he giveth me strength as my day.
 

-----

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock that shadows a dry, thirsty land he hideth my 
life in the depths of his love, and covers me there with his hand, and covers me there 
with his hand.
 

-----

With numberless blessings each moment he crowns, and filled with a fullness divine, I 
sing in my rapture, O glory to God for such a Redeemer as mine!
 

-----

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock that shadows a dry, thirsty land he hideth my 
life in the depths of his love, and covers me there with his hand, and covers me there 
with his hand.
 

-----

When clothed in his brightness, transported I rise to meet him in clouds of the sky, his 
perfect salvation, his wonderful love, I'll shout with the millions on high.

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock that shadows a dry, thirsty land he hideth my 
life in the depths of his love, and covers me there with his hand, and covers me there 
with his hand.
