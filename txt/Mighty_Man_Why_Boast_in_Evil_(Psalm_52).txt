# Mighty Man, Why Boast in Evil? (Psalm 52)

Mighty man, why boast in evil?
For God's mercy is all day long.
With your tongue you plot destruction,
Like a razor, you work deceit.
You love evil more than goodness,
and deceit more than truthful words.
You love all words with destructive power
O you sharp and deceitful tongue.

-----

God will break you down forever,
seize and tear you where you live.
By your roots He then will pull you
from the land of all living men.
Just men see with awe, yet laughing,
"This man would not make God his trust,
But he trusted his abundant wealth,
and in malice he gained his strength."

-----

But in God's house I am growing
like a green fruitful olive tree.
Without ceasing I am trusting
in the firm loyal love of God.
I will give You thanks forever,
for it's You that has done all this;
In your good name I will set my hope
in the midst of Your godly ones.
