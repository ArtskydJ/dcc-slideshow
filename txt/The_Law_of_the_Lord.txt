# The Law of the Lord (Psalm 19:7-11)

The law of the Lord is perfect,
converting the soul;
the testimony of the Lord is sure,
making wise the simple.

-----

More to be desired are they than gold.
Yea, than much fine gold:
sweeter also than honey
and the honeycomb.

-----

The statues of the Lord are right,
rejoicing the heart:
the commandment of the Lord is pure,
enlightening the eyes.

-----

More to be desired are they than gold.
Yea, than much fine gold:
sweeter also than honey
and the honeycomb.

-----

The fear of the Lord is clean,
enduring forever;
the judgments of the Lord are true
and righteous altogether.

-----

More to be desired are they than gold.
Yea, than much fine gold:
sweeter also than honey
and the honeycomb.

-----

Moreover by them is Thy servant warned:
is Thy servant warned:
and in keeping of them there is
great reward.
