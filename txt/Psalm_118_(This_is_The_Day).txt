# Psalm 118 (This is the Day)

This is the day the Lord has made;
He calls the hours His own;
Let heav'n rejoice, let earth be glad,
and praise surround the throne.

-----

Today He rose and left the dead,
and Satan's empire fell;
Today the saints Hid triumphs spread,
and all His wonders tell.

-----

Hosanna to th'anointed King,
to David's holy Son!
Help us, O Lord; descend and bring salvation from the throne.

-----

Blest be the Lord, who comes to me with messages of grace;
who comes in God His Father's name
to save our sinful race.

-----

Hosanna in the highest strains the
church on earth can raise!
The highest heav'ns in which He reigns
all give Him nobler praise.

> Isaac Watts, 1719
