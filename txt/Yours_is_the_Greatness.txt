# Yours is the Greatness

Yours is the greatness,
Yours is the power.
Yours is the glory alone.
The majesty and splendor,
the wealth and the honor,
the strength and the wisdom, oh Lord.

-----

You are exalted as head over all.
Praise to Your glorious name.
Ev'rything in heaven and earth is Yours.
Forever Your Kingdom will reign.

-----

Yours is the greatness,
Yours is the power.
Yours is the glory alone.
The majesty and splendor,
the wealth and the honor,
The strength and the wisdom, oh Lord.
