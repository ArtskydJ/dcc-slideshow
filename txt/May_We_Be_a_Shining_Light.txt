# May We Be a Shining Light

May we be a shining light to the nations,
a shining light to the peoples of the earth; 
till the whole world sees the glory of your name.
May your pure light shine through us.

-----

May we bring a word of hope to the nations,
a word of life to the peoples of the earth; 
till the whole world knows
there's salvation through your name.
May your mercy flow through us.

-----

May your kingdom come to the nations,
your will be done in the peoples of the earth;
till the whole world knows
that Jesus Christ is Lord.
May your kingdom come through us.
May your kingdom come through us. 
May your will be done on earth.
