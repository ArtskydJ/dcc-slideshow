# Make Me a Captive, Lord

Make me a captive, Lord,
and then I shall be free.
Force me to render up my sword,
and I shall conqueror be.
I sink in life's alarms
when by myself I stand;
Imprison me within Thine arms,
and strong shall be my hand.

-----

My heart is weak and poor
until it master find;
It has no spring of action sure,
it varies with the wind.
It cannot freely move
till Thou has wrought its chain;
Enslave it with Thy matchless love,
and deathless it shall reign.

-----

My power is faint and low
till I have learned to serve;
It lacks the needed fire to glow,
it lacks the breeze to nerve.
It cannot drive the world
until itself be driven;
Its flag can only be unfurled
when Thou shalt breathe from heaven.

-----

My will is not my own
till Thou hast made it Thine;
If it would reach a monarch's throne,
it must its crown resign.
It only stands unbent
amid the clashing strife,
When on Thy bosom it has leant,
and found in Thee its life.
