# O Church Arise

O church arise and put your armor on,
hear the call of Christ our Captain.
For now the weak can say that they are strong
in the strength that God has given.

-----

With shield of faith and belt of truth
we'll stand against the devil's lies.
An army bold whose battle cry is Love
reaching out to those in darkness.

-----

Our call to war to love the captive soul,
but to rage against the captor,
and with the sword that makes the wounded whole
we will fight with faith and valour.

-----

When faced with trials on every side
we know the outcome is secure,
and Christ will have the prize for which He died,
an inheritance of nations.

-----

Come see the cross where love and mercy meet,
as the Son of God is stricken.
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet
for the Conqueror has risen.

-----

And as the stone is rolled away,
and Christ emerges from the grave
this victory march continues till the day,
every eye and heart shall see Him.

-----

So Spirit come put strength in every stride
give grace for every hurdle,
that we may run with faith to win the prize
of a servant good and faithful.

-----

As saints of old still line the way
retelling triumphs of His grace,
we hear their calls and hunger for the day
when with Christ we stand in glory.
