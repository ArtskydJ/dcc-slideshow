# Psalm 100

All earth, with joy, to the LORD
come with loud voices ringing.
With gladness serve the LORD;
come to him joyfully singing.

-----

The LORD is God.
Know that he made us his own.
We are the sheep of his pasture.

-----

Enter his gates with thanksgiving,
to his courts come praising.
To him be thankful, and bless his name,
your voices raising.
