# I Will Give Thanks

I will give thanks to Thee,
O Lord, among the people,
I will sing praises to Thee among the nations.
For thy steadfast love is great,
is great to the heavens, 
and thy faithfulness,
thy faithfulness to the clouds.

-----

Be exalted, O God, above the heavens,
let Thy glory be over all the earth.
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens,
let Thy glory be over all the earth.
