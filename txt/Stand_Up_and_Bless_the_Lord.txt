# Stand Up and Bless the Lord

Stand up and bless the Lord,
Ye people of his choice;
Stand up, and bless the Lord
your God with heart and soul and voice.

-----

Though high above all praise,
Above all blessing high,
Who would not fear his holy Name,
and laud, and magnify?

-----

O for the living flame,
From his own altar brought,
To touch our lips, our minds inspire,
And wing to heav'n our thought.

-----

God is our strength and song
And His salvation ours
Then be His love in Christ proclaim'd
With all our ransomed pow'rs

-----

Stand up and bless the Lord
The Lord your God adore
Stand up and bless His glorious name Henceforth forevermore.
