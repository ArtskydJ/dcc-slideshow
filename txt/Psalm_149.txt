# Psalm 149

O praise the LORD! O sing aloud
a new song to the LORD!
Where faithful ones assembled are
his praise in song accord.
With joy in his Creator now
let Israel shout and sing,
and trembling let all Zion's sons
be joyful in their King.

-----

O let them in the whirling dance
give praise to his great name.
Let them with sound of harp and drum
sing psalms of praise to him.
That people which the LORD has claimed
is pleasant in his eyes,
and with salvation's radiance
the meek he beautifies.

-----

In glory let the faithful ones
exult with lifted heads.
Let them for gladness shout aloud
and sing upon their beds.
O let the lofty praise of God
from out their throats be poured,
and let them have within their hand
a sharp two-edged sword.

-----

On nations thus to take revenge
and punish heathen folk,
to chain their kings, and on their chiefs
to bind an iron yoke,
on them the judgment execute
found written in his word;
this honor all his faithful have.
O do ye praise the LORD.
