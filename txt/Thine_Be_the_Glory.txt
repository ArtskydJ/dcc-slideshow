# Thine Be the Glory

Thine be the glory risen, conqu'ring Son; endless in the vict'ry; thou o'er death hast won; angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away. Kept the folded grave clothes, where they body lay.

Thine be the glory, risen conqu'ring Son; endless is the vict'ry thou o'er death hast won.

Lo! Jesus meets us. Risen from the tomb lovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom; let the church with gladness hymns of triumph sing, for her Lord now liveth, death hath lost its sting. 

-----

Thine be the glory, risen conqu'ring Son; endless is the vict'ry thou o'er death hast won.

No more we doubt thee, glorious Prince of life; life is naught without thee: aid us in our strife: make us more than conqu'rors, thro' thy deathless love: bring us safe thro' Jordan to thy home above.
