# Sing Praise to the Lord (Psalm 149)

Sing praise to the Lord; come sing a new song.
Amid all His saints His praises prolong.
Let Israel be glad in their Maker and sing;
let all Zion's people rejoice in their King.

-----

With timbrel and harp and joyful acclaim, 
with dancing and song give praise to His name
For God in His people His pleasure will seek,
with robes of salvation adorning the meek. 

-----

In glory exult, you saints of the Lord;
with songs in the night high praises accord.
Go forth in His service, be strong in His might
to conquer all evil stand for the right. 

-----

For this is God's word His saints shall not fail, but over the earth their power shall prevail.
All kingdoms and nations shall yield to their sword Thus God shows his glory. 
Sing praise to the Lord!

> Psalm 149. William Croft, 1708
