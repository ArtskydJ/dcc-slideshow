# A Battle Hymn

Forth to the battle rides our King;
He climbs the conquering car;
He fits His arrows to the string,
and hurls His bolts afar.

-----

Convictions pierce the stoutest hearts,
they smart, they bleed, they die,
Slain by Immanuel's well-aimed darts,
in helpless heaps they lie.

-----

Behold, He bares His two-edged sword,
and deals almighty blows;
His all-revealing, killing Word
'twixt joints and marrow goes.

-----

Who can resist Him in the fight?
He cuts through coats of mail.
Before the terror of His might
the hearts of rebels fail. 

-----

Anon, arrayed in robes of grace,
He rides the trampled plain,
With pity beaming in His face,
and mercy in His train.

-----

Mighty to save He now appears,
mighty to raise the dead,
Mighty to staunch the bleeding wound,
and lift the fallen head. 

-----

Victor alike in love and arms,
myriads around Him bend;
Each captive owns His matchless charms, each foe becomes His friend.

-----

They crown Him on the battle-field,
they press to kiss His feet;
Their hands, their hearts,
their all they yield: 
His conquest is complete.

-----

None love Him more than those He slew;
His love their hate has slain;
Henceforth their souls are
all on fire to spread His gentle reign.
