# Rise Up, O Men of God 

Rise up O men of God,
have done with lesser things.
Give heart and soul and mind and strength
to serve the King of kings.

-----

Rise up O men of God,
his kingdom tarries long.
Bring in the day of brotherhood
and end the night of wrong.

-----

Rise up the Lord is calling,
rise up this is the day.
Rise up and seize the moment,
rise up O men of faith.

-----

Rise up O men of God,
the church for you doth wait.
Her strength unequal to her task
rise up and make her great.

-----

Lift high the cross of Christ,
tread where his feet have trod.
As brothers of the Son of Man
rise up O men of God!

-----

Rise up the Lord is calling,
rise up this is the day.
Rise up and seize the moment,
rise up O men of faith.
