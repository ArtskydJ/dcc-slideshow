# Blessed Be the Tie That Binds 

Blessed be the tie that binds
our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
is like that to that above.

-----

Before our Father's throne
we pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
our comforts and our cares.

-----

We share each other's woes,
our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
the sympathizing tear.

-----

When we asunder part,
it gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
and hope to meet again.
