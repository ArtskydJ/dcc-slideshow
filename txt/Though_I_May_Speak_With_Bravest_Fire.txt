# Though I May Speak with Bravest Fire

Though I may speak with bravest fire,
and have the gift to all inspire,
And have not love, my words are vain,
as sounding brass, and hopeless gain.

-----

Though I may give all I possess,
and striving so my love profess,
But not be giv'n by love within,
the profit soon turns strangely thin.

-----

Come, Spirit, come, our hearts control,
our spirits long to be made whole.
Let inward love guide every deed;
by this we worship and are freed.
