# Psalm 51

God, be merciful to me;
On Your love I rest my plea.
By Your vast abounding grace,
My transgressions all erase.
From the stain of every sin,
wash, and make me clean within.

-----

For my sins before me rise,
always present to my eyes.
I have sinned 'gainst You alone,
In Your sight I've evil done;
So Your words are proven true,
righteous are Your judgments, too.

-----

Truly, I was born in sin,
sinful when conceived within.
Surely You desire to find
Faithfulness in heart and mind;
You will, deep within my heart,
wisdom unto me impart.

-----

O with hyssop sprinkle me,
and from sin I clean will be;
Wash me from its stain, and so,
I'll be whiter than the snow.
Make me hear joy's cheering voice,
Let the bones you crushed rejoice.
