# Psalm 132:1-12

Hallelujah! Praise the Lord's name! Praise Him servants of the Lord, 
you that in the Lord's house serve him, in God's courtyard standing guard. 
Praise the Lord! How good the Lord is! Sing His name, how sweet its tone! 
For the Lord has chosen Jacob, Israel to be His own.

# Psalm 132;1-12

Well I know how great the Lord is; 
our Lord is above all gods. For the Lord does what He pleases in all heav'n, earth, deeps and floods. 
He it is who lifts the vapors from the ends of earth and sea., 
who with lightnings brings the rain down, from His store the wind sets free.

# Psalm 132:1-12

Who slew all of Egypt's first born, on you, 
Egypt, wonders sent, signs to Pharaoh and His servants, who killed kings, their kingdoms rent, 
mighty Sihon, Og of Bashan, then the kings of Cannan fell! God their land gave to his people. 
Willed it all to Israel.
