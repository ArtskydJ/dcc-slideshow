# Creator of All

Creator of all
we were made for Your pleasure, 
You are jealous for us
for You see our lives as a treasure. 

-----

You want to walk with us day by day,
to have a people who gladly say, 
"Lord, we belong to You alone. 
We bow before no other throne 
for You have redeemed us with Your sacrifice,
our lives are not our own."

-----

"Lord, we belong to You alone
so come dwell in us, make Your glory known. 
Our greatest joy is found in knowing You, belonging to You alone."

-----

Almighty God,
You've held plans for us through the ages, 
You give each life a call
and a reason for being created. 

-----

We want to be a house You have built,
a living temple that You have filled.
Lord, we belong to You alone. 
We bow before no other throne 
for You have redeemed us with Your sacrifice, our lives are not our own. 

-----

Lord we belong to You alone
so come dwell in us, make Your glory known. 
Our greatest joy is found in knowing You, belonging to You alone.

-----

Lord we belong to You alone
so come dwell in us, make Your glory known. 
Our greatest joy is found in knowing You, belonging to You alone.
