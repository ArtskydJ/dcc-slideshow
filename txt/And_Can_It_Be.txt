# And Can It Be

Amazing love, how can it be?
Amazing love, how can it be?

-----

And can it be that I should gain
an int'rest in the Savior's blood? 
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?

-----

Amazing love! How can it be
that Thou, my God, should die for me?
Amazing love! How can it be
that Thou, my God, should die for me? 

-----

He left His Father's throne above;
so free, so infinite His grace! 
Humbled Himself, so great His love!
And bled for Adam's helpless race!

-----

'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
for, O my God, it found out me. 
Amazing love! How can it be
that Thou, my God, should die for me?

-----

Long my imprisoned spirit lay
fast bound in sin and nature's night. 
Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray;
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light.

-----

My chains fell off, my heart was free.
I rose, went forth, and followed thee.
Amazing love! How can it be
that Thou, my God, should die for me? 

-----

No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine! 
Alive in Him, my living Head,
and clothed in righteousness divine, 
bold I approach the eternal throne,
and claim the crown, through Christ my own.

-----

Amazing love! How can it be
that Thou, my God, should die for me? 
Amazing love! How can it be
that Thou, my God, should die for me?
