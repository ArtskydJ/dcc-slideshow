# Have Thine Own Way, Lord

Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way! 
Thou art the potter; I am the clay.
Mold me and make me after thy will, 
while I
am waiting, yielded and still.

Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way! 
Search me and try me, Master today!
Mold me and make me after thy will, 
while I am waiting, yielded and still.

-----

Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way! 
Wounded and weary, help me, I pray!
Power, all power, surely is thine! 
Touch me and heal me, Savior divine!

-----

Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way! 
Hold o'er my being absolute sway!
Fill with thy Spirit till all shall see Christ only,
always, living in me!
