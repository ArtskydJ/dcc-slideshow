# New King James Version

There is no soundness in my flesh
         because of your anger, 
         nor any health in my bones 
         because of my sin.
For my iniquities have gone over my head;
         like a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
My wounds are foul and festering
         because of my foolishness.
