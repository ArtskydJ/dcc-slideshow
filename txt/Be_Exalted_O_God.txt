# Be Exalted, O God

I will give thanks to Thee,
O Lord, among the people;
I will sing praises to Thee among the nations.
For Thy steadfast love is great,
is great to the heavens,
and Thy faithfulness,
Thy faithfulness to the clouds. 

-----

Be exalted, O God,
above the heavens;
let Thy glory be over all the earth. 
Be exalted, O God,
above the heavens;
let Thy glory be over all the earth.

I will give thanks to Thee,
O Lord, among the people;
I will sing praises to Thee among the nations.
For Thy steadfast love is great,
is great to the heavens,
and Thy faithfulness,
Thy faithfulness to the clouds. 

-----

Be exalted, O God,
above the heavens;
let Thy glory be over all the earth. 
Be exalted, O God,
above the heavens;
let Thy glory… let Thy glory…
let Thy glory be over all the earth.
