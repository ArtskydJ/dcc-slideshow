# How Majestic Is Your Name

O LORD, our LORD how majestic is
your name in all the earth. 
O LORD, our LORD how majestic is
your name in all the earth. 

-----

O LORD,
we praise your name; 
O LORD,
we magnify your name: 
Prince of Peace, Mighty God.
O LORD God Almighty. 

-----

Give unto the LORD, O you mighty ones,
give unto him glory and strength. 
Give unto the LORD, O you mighty ones
the glory due unto his name. 

-----

We worship
you, O LORD, 
in the beauty
of your Holiness. 
All you heav'ns and all the earth,
sing praise to him who reigns on high.
