# Blessed Be the Tie That Binds 

Blessed be the tie that binds
our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
is like that to that above.

-----

Before our Father's throne
we pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims
are one our comforts and our cares.

-----

We share each other's woes,
our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
the sympathizing tear.

-----

When we asunder part,
it gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
and hope to meet again.

-----

This glorious hope revives
our courage by the way;
While each in expectation lives,
and longs to see the day.

-----

From sorrow, toil and pain,
and sin, we shall be free,
And perfect love and friendship reign through all eternity.
