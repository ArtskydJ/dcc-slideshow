# Psalm 56

Be gracious unto me, O God,
for man would me devour;
he fights against me all day long,
oppressing by his power.
My foes are watching day and night
that they may me devour.

-----

Because against me many are
who fight from places high,
The day I fear I'll trust in thee.
God's word I'll magnify.
In God I trust. What can flesh do?
Of that no fear have I.

-----

All day they wrest my words;
their thoughts toward me are filled with hate.
They meet, they lurk, they mark my steps,
as for my soul they wait.
Is there indeed escape for them
with wickedness so great?

-----

In anger, God, cast peoples down
in what they undertook.
Thou numberest my wanderings,
not one dost overlook.
Within thy bottle put my tears;
are they not in thy book?

-----

My foes shall , when I cry, turn back,
I know; God is for me.
In God I'll praise His word; the Lord-
His word my praise shall be!
In God I've trusted, I'll not fear
what man can do to me.

-----

My vows to thee I'll pay, O God;
thankoff'rings bring to thee.
For thou from death didst save my soul,
my feet from falling free;
I'll walk before God in the light
of those that living be.
