# Mighty Lord, Extend Your Kingdom 

Mighty Lord, extend Your kingdom,
Be the truth with triumph crowned;
Let the lands that sit in darkness
hear the glorious gospel sound,
From our borders, from our borders,
to the world's remotest bound.

-----

By Your arm, eternal Father,
scatter far the shades of night;
Let the great Immanuel's kingdom,
open like the morning light.
Let all barriers, let all barriers,
yield before Your heavenly might.

-----

Come in all Your Spirit's power;
Come, Your reign on earth restore;
In Your strength ride forth and conquer,
Still advancing more and more.
Till all people, till all people,
Shall Your holy Name adore.
