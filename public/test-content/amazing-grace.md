# Amazing Grace

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
 that saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost but now am found,
 was blind, but now, I see.
--------------------------------------------
T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear,
 and Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear,
 the hour I first believed.
--------------------------------------------
Through many dangers, toils and snares,
 we have already come.
T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far,
 and Grace will lead us home.
--------------------------------------------
The Lord has promised good to me,
 His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be,
 as long as life endures.
--------------------------------------------
When we've been here ten thousand years,
 bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise,
 then when we've first begun.
--------------------------------------------
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
 that saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost but now am found,
 was blind, but now, I see.
